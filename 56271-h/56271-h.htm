  <h2 class='c006'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In a home free from nuisances which offend the esthetic
tastes, and either directly or indirectly cause disease, more
contentment and thrift will be found than in the one permeated
with odors and befouled with dirt and domestic
wastes.</p>

<p class='c000'>So it is with a city, the great home, workshop, and playground
of its people. Keeping it clean, therefore, is one
of the most important duties of its officials. None other
is more conducive to health, happiness and comfort, the
three great objects for which every community through organized
effort is striving.</p>

<p class='c000'>And there is no group of municipal problems which demands
and is now commanding, more scientific thought and
more intelligent business management than the collection
and disposal of a city’s wastes. With every nation applying
the last ounce of economy and with the increase of population
and its consequent congestion, these problems grow
in importance and complexity. Higher living standards,
a better understanding of the causes of disease, and a keener
appreciation of preventive work have forced municipalities
to frown upon primitive methods involving individual effort,
especially where congestion exists. As a substitute
therefore, more effective means have been and are being
adopted to eliminate by community activity, the nuisances
caused by ashes, rubbish, garbage and dirty streets. We
are also appreciating the need for more efficient management
than is now prevalent and for the development of
revenue-producing by-products.</p>

<p class='c000'>An official or layman interested in the solution of these
six important municipal housecleaning problems will find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>in this book information which we believe will answer all
his questions. Our judgment has been influenced entirely
by the hundreds of questions which have come to the State
Bureau of Municipal Information from city officials in
their effort either to establish efficient systems or to reorganize
existing ones.</p>

<p class='c000'>City officials, federal, state and municipal reports, engineering,
medical and other publications, as well as the
proceedings of various municipal, civic and scientific organizations
have contributed their quota to this work.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_xix'>xix</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Never in the history of our country has the work of the
public official demanded so much of him as now. The expansion
and increasing complexity of municipal activities,
the desire of women for more knowledge about their new responsibilities,
the need for better living conditions brought
about by greater congestion, the necessity for conserving
every ounce of man and woman power, the demand for
greater efficiency and rock-bottom economy in every line—all
these conditions are making themselves felt with the
public official.</p>

<p class='c000'>The time when public office was held by the grace of God
and the majority of votes has become almost a thing of the
past. The official’s worth now is not measured by his good-fellowship
and vote-getting capacity, but rather by his
ability to produce results—not at the polls on Election Day,
but in the City Hall every day.</p>

<p class='c000'>Because municipal government is closer to the people
and affects them in more ways than the government of any
other political subdivision, and also because our citizens are
now taking a keener interest than ever before in community
work, it is to-day almost useless for a public official to attempt
to escape responsibility or to excuse his shortcomings.
He must be efficient and constantly apply his efficiency.</p>

<p class='c000'>I believe that most of our urban citizens appreciate the
importance of keeping our cities clean and healthful by the
proper removal and disposal of the mass of wastes that accumulates
daily. I know that every public official appreciates
the need for this service, and most of them by bitter
experiences realize the complexity of these problems.</p>

<p class='c000'>To equip himself to do his difficult duty as he should, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xx'>xx</span>public official must be able to acquaint himself thoroughly
with the best methods, experiences and opinions of others.
“Municipal Housecleaning” goes into all of the matters
pertaining to the collection, care and removal of municipal
wastes. It should be of the greatest value in assisting public
officials—mayors, engineers, sanitarians and members of
health, street cleaning, public works and sewer departments—to
select the systems best adapted to local conditions and
to operate them efficiently. We officials in New York State
have found this information to be of inestimable value in
solving our problems.</p>

<p class='c000'>But no municipal effort can succeed without the cooperation
of the citizen. He can help most by informing
himself on these problems so that he can intelligently participate
in the cooperative community effort to keep clean,
and if need be, to offer constructive criticism. If the citizen—and
particularly the woman, for it is her intelligent cooperation
that will make for more effective service—will
read this book, it will be easier for us to obtain in America
what the authors have so aptly referred to as “better places
in which to live, work and play.”</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>STREET CLEANING<br /> <span class='large'>SYSTEMS AND APPARATUS USED IN AMERICAN CITIES—METHODS OF REDUCING LITTER—COST DATA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In establishing or rearranging its street cleaning system,
every city must consider the problem from three angles:
(1) Cheapest method of cleaning pavement; (2) Method of
reducing litter; (3) Paving policy with a view to saving
cost of cleaning.</p>

<p class='c000'>The proper solution of each one of these problems will
materially reduce the cost.</p>

<p class='c000'>In outlining a program for a street cleaning department
the following elements must be known and carefully considered:</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>(1)</dt>
    <dd>Kind of and state of repair of pavement.
    </dd>
    <dt>(2)</dt>
    <dd>Traffic to which they are subjected.
    </dd>
    <dt>(3)</dt>
    <dd>Facilities for disposing of street sweepings.
    </dd>
    <dt>(4)</dt>
    <dd>Climatic peculiarities.
    </dd>
    <dt>(5)</dt>
    <dd>Degree of cleanliness it is desired or expected to maintain.
    </dd>
    <dt>(6)</dt>
    <dd>Miscellaneous local circumstances.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c000'>Mr. S. Whinery, Consulting Engineer, says that in most
cities the data afforded by local past experience and results,
furnish the best basis for future projects and programs.
Unfortunately few cities have records of these. The head
of the department usually relies upon his own memory or
that of his predecessor. While the methods followed and
results obtained in other cities may and should be studied,
it must be borne in mind that it is not safe to base conclusions
upon such data without a full knowledge and careful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>consideration of all facts and conditions affecting them.
This is particularly true of reported cost data, for in addition
to differing physical conditions, it is unfortunately
true that the present methods of accounting in many street
cleaning departments make it next to impossible to ascertain
the actual or relative unit cost of the various details of
the work, and intelligently to compare results in one city
with those in another. The experience of the New York
State Bureau of Municipal Information in seeking data
from the fifty largest American and all New York State
cities provides ample proof of this condition. Fifty were
able to give some data, but of these only a few had any accurate
and detailed cost statistics.</p>

<p class='c000'>The relative amount of dirt from the different sources
of dust depends on the character of construction and condition
of street surface, amount and character of traffic,
character of neighborhood and people in the neighborhood,
and street railway tracks.</p>

<p class='c000'>Street dirt is divided into two general classes: (a) Natural,
and therefore unavoidable, and (b) that due to carelessness
and therefore avoidable. In the first class are dust
from the air, and dirt coming from the wear of pavements,
vehicles, tires and horses’ shoes; excrement of animals, dirt
and sand which work up through the joints of pavements,
laid on earth or sand foundations and having sand or gravel
joints; dirt brought in from adjacent unpaved or macadam
streets, and leaves from shade trees. In the second class
are soot, refuse swept from sidewalks, thrown from buildings
and discarded by pedestrians, dirt dropped from overloaded
vehicles and débris from construction operations.</p>

<p class='c000'>The real duty of the street cleaning department is the removal
of the first class, but in doing so it is compelled also
to sweep up and cart away the material in the second class.
In order to reduce its operations as much as possible, it
must, therefore, in cooperation with the police and health
authorities do everything it can to prevent the accumulation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>of the avoidable material by enforcing ordinances and
through the cooperation of the public in general.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Contract vs. Municipal Cleaning</h3>

<p class='c017'>It is generally agreed that street cleaning by municipal
employees is more satisfactory and economical than by contract.
Even the officials of those few cities which still have
the contract system favor municipal operation. Philadelphia
is the only one of the twenty-five largest cities in the
country which does the work by contract. The chief of
the highway department has recommended a change, giving
the following reasons: “Street cleaning work involves
so much detail for which there are no definite units to
specify and bid for, and it is of such a character that the
overhead charges for proper inspection are so disproportionate
to the cost of the work, that unquestionably it would
be much more effectively and economically carried on
directly by the municipal forces instead of by contract.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Washington’s experience is illuminating. Notwithstanding
changes in method as work progressed and considerable
expense attached to the purchase of new equipment
the street cleaning department was able to show at
the end of the year under the municipal system that the
average costs were less than contract prices. At the end
of the second year for the expenditure of the same amount
of money over 25 per cent. more work was accomplished
than during the last year of the contract system and the
general opinion was that the streets were in better condition
than they had ever been before.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Method of Reducing Litter</h3>

<p class='c017'>Street cleaning departments of many progressive cities
within the last few years have given particular attention
to the preventive side of street cleaning work, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i>, reducing
the amount of avoidable dirt on street pavements. Various
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>methods have been adopted to secure results. Local civic
pride and the cooperation of the public have been stimulated
by means of educational campaigns. One result has
been the more general use of waste paper and refuse street
cans. Cleveland tried to organize volunteer corps among
the school children to use their influence against the useless
littering of streets. Departments have also established
a closer relationship with the health and police authorities
for the enforcement of street cleaning regulations, such as
those prohibiting the sweeping of litter from stores and
houses onto paved streets. The success of preventive work
depends upon the amount of cooperation the street cleaners
can get from these sources.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Chicago an analysis was made of the character and
percentage of waste thrown about by pedestrians in the
streets and by business houses in densely populated sections
of the city. It was found that a great portion of the street
dirt collected by street cleaners consisted of waste paper
and other light litter. The Chicago Civil Service Commission
in a special report says: “It would appear that with
the cooperation of merchants a considerable portion of such
litter could be kept off the streets and if street cleaners
would patrol the street for loose paper and deposit the
same in the street dirt boxes provided at different points
along such streets, a great portion of the cleaning work
would be saved and the streets would generally appear
cleaner. The litter of streets in tenement and manufacturing
districts is a matter which can be greatly minimized by
proper distribution of work and cooperation of the street
cleaning forces and residents. The quantity of street dirt
collected from the pavements in market places illustrates an
instance where pavements become unavoidably littered.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Gustave H. Hanna, when head of the Cleveland Street
Cleaning Department, expressed the belief that nothing encourages
carefulness on the part of the public so much as
efficient and careful cleaning. He argued that a man does
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>not hesitate to throw paper or rubbish into a foul street,
but thinks twice if the street is clean. If there is a waste
box at hand with a printed suggestion on the outside, Mr.
Hanna thinks he is apt to use the box.</p>

<p class='c000'>The greatest source of expense comes from those who use
the street as a place of business, such as resorts of professional
hucksters. Mr. Hanna and others think it would
be a small return for the permission of doing business in
these streets to require the hucksters to keep the surroundings
clean at their own expense under pain of arrest or forfeiture
of privilege.</p>

<p class='c000'>In an effort to get the cooperation of the general public,
Philadelphia placed waste paper receptacles in prominent
locations throughout the city, such as two in every block in
the principal business sections, in front of school houses
and entrances to business, elevated and subway stations,
etc. Circulars were sent to each householder throughout
the city containing information and instruction as to improving
conditions by using uniform and suitable receptacles.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bulletins and letters of information were distributed
among business and civic associations. The officials learned
that one of the most effective methods in reaching the
householder is through the women’s organizations. A
woman inspector was appointed to keep in touch with the
activities of the women’s clubs and to secure their cooperation.
This inspector during the year gave over two hundred
lectures to various organizations and enlisted the cooperation
of householders, women and children in connection
with preventive street cleaning measures. To the
housekeeper it was shown how vital is her part in an efficient
collection of all waste. Children were impressed with their
duties as citizens, and to them was given an opportunity to
demonstrate their knowledge in the home, school and on
the street. As a reward of such activity 5,000 buttons were
distributed in six months. Twenty thousand folders for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>children and adults relating to the care of streets and the
collection of waste were also put into circulation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Former Street Cleaning Commissioner William H. Edwards,
of New York, says that four kinds of cooperation
are needed by street cleaning departments:</p>

<p class='c000'>(1) “Cooperation with the force by showing a human
interest in the work of the men. This can be done by
establishing a pension fund so that when a man has served
faithfully for twenty years and has reached the age of 60
or has become incapacitated after he has served ten years,
or is injured in the performance of his duty at any time
after service has begun so that he is disabled for future
service, he can be retired on half pay. This instills in men
a keen desire to do better work and permits the Commissioner
to retire men who are no longer able to do good work.
The danger of street sweepers in busy streets is apparent
to any one. More than 2,500 accidents resulting in death
or personal injury or damage to property occurred in one
year in connection with the New York City Department’s
activities. The percentage of killed in the street cleaning
force was considerably higher than that in the police force.</p>

<p class='c000'>(2) “Cooperation of women in the communities in New
York. The Women’s Municipal League and other bodies
have cooperated with the department. Every year they
offer a medal to the sweeper, driver or foreman who does
the best all around work.</p>

<p class='c000'>(3) “Cooperation with citizens. Carelessness up to
the present time has added to the work and expense and
has been an obstacle to real cleanliness. It must be remembered
that before the sweeper can begin that part of the
work which is beyond prevention, he must remove the litter
carelessly thrown on the street.</p>

<p class='c000'>(4) “The formation of ordinances for the prevention
of this carelessness. If the department has the effective
cooperation of the police department and of the magistrates,
in the enforcement of the ordinances, then and only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>then can this particular condition be reduced to a practical
minimum. In an attempt to enforce ordinances forbidding
the throwing of litter in the streets, New York City in 1915
caused the arrest of 5,400 persons for violating ordinances
relating to street conditions of the scattering of refuse. In
addition to these arrests in the last three months of the year
more than 18,000 formal written warnings were issued for
the violation of ordinances.”</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Street Cleaning Factors and Standards</h3>

<p class='c017'>The conditions and factors controlling the amount and
frequency of cleaning of any pavement, are as follows:</p>

  <dl class='dl_2'>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>1. Density of horse drawn vehicles and other traffic.
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>2. Width of street.
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>3. Character of district and population.
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>4. Location of streets.
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>5. Proximity of streets and alleys.
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>6. Location of public buildings, parks, etc.
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>7. Kinds and condition of pavement.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c000'>A study made by the Chicago Civil Service Commission
definitely established that the density of horse traffic, which
is the total number of horses passing through a given street
divided by the width of the street, is the principal factor
which determines the number and frequency of cleanings
one street should be given.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Commission has also learned that there are at least
thirty-eight distinct movements which a street cleaner
makes in street cleaning work. Of these some have been
found to be unproductive, resulting in loss of time and
energy and less effective street cleaning. The most important
of these, according to the Commission’s report, are as
follows: Observation of time wheeling push carts into alleys
or other dumping places, disclosing that practically one-fifth
of time was consumed in this activity. The study disclosed
that some sweepers are more efficient than others,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>due to the stroke of the broom which they make. The practise
of hitting a broom on the pavement is not necessary
on dry pavements and very seldom on wet pavements. Effective
and practical street cleaning can be obtained by
bringing the brush down forcibly at the beginning of each
stroke, thus reducing the work at least 15 per cent. The
time schedules disclosed that time lost by street cleaners
in dodging horses and automobiles where traffic is dense
is unappreciable and does not exceed 8 per cent. of the
total time in the business district and not more than 2 per
cent. of the total time in the outlying district. It is occasioned
more through congestion of traffic than through
density of traffic. In cleaning light traffic asphalt pavements
it was disclosed that after the one morning thorough
cleaning three-fourths of the area to be covered during the
remainder of the day does not require thorough cleaning.
The Commission believes that scoops equipped with rollers
would be well adapted for use on light traffic pavements,
and with them one man could patrol a much larger pavement
area and still keep the pavement in good condition.
Time studies of work performed by street laborers working
in gangs showed that work done by groups and gangs was
not as economical as the division of such work through
individual arrangements. Considerable time is lost in conversation.
When one man rests every man on the street
does the same thing. While working in gangs the good
sweeper does no more work than the poorest of the gang.
Where it is desired to cover a large area of street with
men working in groups rather than in gangs it would be
better, the Commission thinks, for each man to have a
definite uniform area to cover and to require the foreman
to time each individual.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Edward D. Very, Sanitary Engineer, says that any
attempt to estimate the amount of materials which accumulate
on a city street must end in failure as the contributing
elements vary in different localities in a city and in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>different cities, and where figures are given they do not
really present any valuable data. Some general principles,
however, have been determined. The Chicago Commission
in its investigation declares that the quantity and volume of
dirt attributed to horse drawn vehicle traffic is the most
important source of street dirt. The loss of sand and
coal and crushed stone, hay, manure and other loose material
from poorly constructed vehicles or overloaded
vehicles adds greatly to the quantity of street dirt to be
removed. Important in a wet season is the dirt carried by
moving vehicles through streets and alleys onto hard pavements,
but the Commission says that the amount of dirt
actually attributable to this source is considerably less than
is usually believed. There is also considerable refuse in
the form of leaves and grass which accumulates in the residential
streets and along boulevards and parks, which has
a tendency to lodge in catch basin inlets and stop the free
flow of storm water. The quantity of leaves accumulating
in the short leaf season on streets far exceeds that which
naturally drops onto the surface of streets alone, because of
the additional cleaning from lawns and parkway spaces.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some reports express the belief that when a fixed standard
is established of basing street cleaning schedules carefully
on density of traffic, condition of pavement, character
of frontage and kind of pavement, a definite relation will be
found between the amount of street sweepings collected
and the number of sweepers employed. In Chicago it has
been found that different sweepers average daily collections
of quantities varying from three-fourths of a cubic yard
to three cubic yards. It has also been noted that street
sweepings collected by regular block sweepers average about
.0045 cubic feet per square yard. The weight of sweepings
will, under ordinary conditions, approximate 36 pounds
per cubic foot.</p>

<p class='c000'>The paving and repair policy of a city is a very important
factor in cleaning rates. Comparatively few cities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>as yet give any thought when selecting a particular pavement
as to the relative cost of keeping it clean. It is also
a fact that in many cities repair work is neglected at the
expense of cleaning.</p>

<p class='c000'>A smooth, hard surface pavement will cost less to keep
clean than one with a rough or uneven surface. A brick
pavement, for instance, costs more to keep clean than sheet
asphalt. For the same reason a street out of repair is
more expensive to clean than one in good repair.</p>

<p class='c000'>Officials agree that a paving policy should be carried
out with a view to having a minimum number of unpaved
approaches to existing pavements in order to prevent mud
being tracked from the highway to pavement. There is
need also of protecting narrow rural pavements from the
overflow or tracking of mud that originates on adjacent
portions of the same highway.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a discussion of paving policies and their relation to
street cleaning Mr. Hanna says: “The construction and
maintenance of pavements that are easy to clean are important
and effectual in saving the cost of street administration.
Little weight is given to cleaning cost when paving
questions are settled and an actual expense of $500 a mile
in repairing residence streets would be considered an appreciable
item of maintenance, yet that figure for cleaning
a mile of residence streets through a season is extremely
low. A street cleaner looks upon two qualities in a pavement.
It must be smooth and particles of litter must not
stick to the surface. The question of smoothness opens up
the whole matter of durability. Any material that deteriorates
or roughens becomes more difficult each year to
clean. Any neglect of needed repairs means a larger cleaning
bill until the repairs have been completed. The twofold
expense resulting from wear, the cost of repairs plus
the increased cost of cleaning should enter into all calculation
of expense. Additional calculation of cleaning expense
must be made for all bituminous pavements on account
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>of the sticking of particles of litter to the surface.
These surfaces are never quite so clean as non-adhesive
materials and it costs from 25 per cent. upwards in additional
cost to put them in a reasonably presentable condition
on account of this quality. This difficulty is seen at
its worst in a new creosoted wood block pavement, when the
oil is gradually working out between the pores of the wood.
The use of steel scrapers must often be employed as the
flushing by water is not at all effective in removing the dirt
from the surface.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Substances most easily cleaned that enter into pavements
are brick and stone. Neither originates any dirt,
and both wash off readily. The only ground for discrimination
between them is on the question of smoothness where
brick has a slight advantage as a rule. In the use of these
materials the choice of a filler is all important. A bituminous
filler has all the disadvantages of a bituminous surface.
Being softer than the brick or block it recedes, leaving a
crevice that invites lodgment of dirt; with edges of brick
or block unprotected it is sure to roughen, thus adding to
the difficulties of cleaning. Such a street after a few years
presents the appearance of cobble stones with the filler invisible
or else melted and run to the gutter where it impedes
work of follow-up gang.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Hanna recommends only a cement grout filler. He
says that West 14th Street in Cleveland has a grouted brick
pavement ten years old and a traffic of two vehicles a
minute. It is cleaned on an average of five times a week,
being flushed by night and hand swept by day. The cost
of cleaning is almost exactly 15 cents per 10,000 of square
feet. This is the lowest figure the city has been able to
reach on any type of pavement. Mr. Hanna says that the
cost on the best asphalt would not be less than 20 cents and
would rise to 30 cents if the surface became wavy or rough.
Wood block costs approximately $1.00 a square to clean
in its initial condition, and it would be at least two years
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>before oil will have dried out sufficiently to admit its being
cleaned for 30 cents a square. Tar filled brick pavement
will cost not less than 30 cents a square, and if the filler
disappears and the block roughens this cost will amount to
60 cents or more. In the case of a pavement 40 feet wide
there are about 21 squares to a mile.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus Mr. Hanna points out that as between a material
that can be cleaned for 15 cents and one that can be cleaned
for 30 cents, there is a difference of $3.15 per mile for cleaning,
a difference of $15.75 per week, or $630 per season of
40 weeks—$6,300 in ten years. In Mr. Hanna’s judgment
cleaning costs can be greatly reduced by a policy of prompt
repair. He believes in the continual patrol of all city
streets by men whose duty it is to discover defects in pavement
and prescribe repair.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Schedule of Street Cleaning</h3>

<p class='c017'>The unit work must be established and the responsibility
of each employee fixed in order to secure an economical administration
of street cleaning. This principle is illustrated
by the so-called “block system.” By this, each man
is allotted to a definite area of pavement to clean, which
varies in extent depending upon local conditions as to traffic,
physical condition of pavement, location of street,
proximity to public buildings, population, paving, alleys,
street cars, right of way and frontage of streets.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is the practise of up-to-date cities to prepare schedules
showing the character of pavement, area of pavement,
number of cleanings or patrols per week, and the standard
of work required of each street cleaner. Changes in these
schedules are necessary from time to time on account of
climatic conditions, street repair and other necessities. The
Chicago Civil Service Commission says that to obtain definite
standards of schedules for cleaning streets and alleys
and the need of repairing such streets, the routing of teams
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>and vehicles, collecting of city waste, the amount and character
and physical condition of all pavements must be obtained.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pavements are usually classified according to physical
character for the purpose of determining the amount and
character of cleaning as follows:</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c000'>Improved—Permanent (a) Smooth pavements, including
asphalt, creosote block and bitulithic. (b) Rough
pavements, including brick, granite, cobble and rubble and
other pavements which require that dirt be picked from
interstices.</p>

<p class='c000'>Improved—Not permanent. All macadam pavements
and country roads.</p>

<p class='c000'>Unimproved pavements. All streets that have not been
paved.</p>

<p class='c000'>The oiling of macadam within the past few years has
had an excellent effect on this kind of pavement and has
given it the solidity and usefulness almost approaching improved
permanent pavements. On macadam surface
streets, periodical removal of rough material with hoes,
brooms and shovels from street surface and gutters and
sprinkling in dry weather with water or oil is about the
best that can be done. An analysis in Chicago of the standard
of work which one man can perform on an oiled macadam
street, indicates that the rate of cleaning one and
three-quarters miles of oiled macadam of average width
in an eight hour day can be reasonably expected of any
man.</p>

<p class='c000'>Much waste is caused by lack of system in laying out
the work and improperly directing the street cleaning gangs
and teams. The attached tables give the systems now being
used in fifty American municipalities. A study of these
will show that some very definite ideas have been developed
by street cleaning officials in this country. For example,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>most cities prefer having patrolmen work singly instead of
in gangs.</p>

<p class='c000'>In making assignments attention should be given to the
smallest details, such as correct reports from foremen as to
the number of streets swept and loads carted away, and
the correct number of sweepers in each street. In many
cities three are sent through a street when two would do.
Dirt wagons should not be started immediately behind
sweeping gangs as it usually takes thirty minutes to an hour
before a gang can sweep up enough dirt for a full load.
Dirt teams should not start for at least one hour after the
sweeper begins. Gangs should have allotted to them enough
work to keep them busy until quitting time so that they do
not have to kill time. Laxity in any part of the system
eats up the department appropriation.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Spring Cleaning</h3>

<p class='c017'>The spring cleaning system usually calls for the piling
up and removal of the heavy dirt which is washed from the
center of the street and which accumulates in the gutters
during the winter season. The experience of cities with
such work indicates that the assignment of one man to a
definite length of street, or the assignment of a small gang
of not exceeding three men, to definite lengths of streets
is more effective and economical.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Chicago Commission says that where a gang of
three men is assigned to the work, team work is developed
by the use of one man in removing the dirt from the roadway
and one man each from the gutters. In the granite
and brick pavements considerably more brooming is necessary
on the roadway. Granite, brick and cedar block pavements
require that the dirt be scraped from the center of
the street to the gutter before piling in the gutters can be
commenced. The center cleaning rates per man in Chicago
are given as follows:</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Street Sprinkling</h3>

<p class='c017'>Although many cities sprinkle their streets for dust
laying only, it is agreed by all experts and the heads of
most street cleaning departments that the use of sprinkling
carts for this purpose is of no value, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i> it is a temporary
makeshift and the result is nil. Sprinkling alone does not
clean pavements, but only converts temporarily the fine
dust into mud, which is a nuisance. It is quite generally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>agreed, too, that sprinkling is responsible for much repair
work on pavements.</p>

<p class='c000'>The number of times a street is sprinkled daily depends
upon weather conditions, nature of pavement and location,
and rarely exceeds four trips. Where flushing and squeegeeing
are done sprinkling is eliminated entirely.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Providence, Rhode Island, bituminous pavements are
not sprinkled by water. They are kept clean by patrol system
and reasonably free from dust. It is the belief of
officials of that city that the use of water has an injurious
effect on the pavement.</p>

<p class='c000'>George D. Warren, of Boston, an expert on paving, says
that street sprinkling as it is generally practised is worse
than a useless expense. He points to the fact that there
has been no sprinkling in Providence in seven years on all
kinds of pavement, except that water bound pavement is
occasionally sprinkled with oil or oil emulsion. If bituminous
pavement surfaces are dry and clean the oil which
drips from automobiles is quickly spread by auto tires to
an extremely thin sheet, which not only preserves the pavement,
but the slight amount of oil takes up the fine dust and
materially helps to prevent the surface from even becoming
dusty.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Warren believes that while some forms of pavement
are doubtless more affected by water and mud than
others, sprinkling injuriously affects all classes of pavement.
Continuing he says: “I believe that repairs required to all
classes of pavement are more generally the result of wetting
down the dirt, leaving the surface in a more or less muddy
condition than by traffic, or rather what would be traffic under
dry cleaning conditions. A city or street in or on which
sprinkling or other methods of continual wetting of pavement
surface has not been practised is almost usually one
where the pavements are the best of their kind. Washington
has the enviable reputation of having the most durable
pavement of all kinds. For many years the system of cleaning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>there has been hand patrol without sprinkling, except
a very light sprinkling, just enough to lay the dust, not to
convert it into mud—immediately in advance of night
sweeping.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fifth Avenue, New York, is always dry except during
rains, and we find one of the most durable asphalt pavements
in the world. The pavement is always clean and
never dusty.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Asphalt pavement on Alexander Street, Rochester,
New York, laid in 1885, is still in existence and has a record
for low cost of repairs, and has until quite recently been
free from street sprinkling. It is now rapidly deteriorating.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Rutger Street, in Utica, New York, laid in 1886, has
been through a similar experience of no sprinkling. Michigan
Boulevard in Chicago, from Jackson Boulevard to
10th Street, was paved partly with creosoted wood block and
partly with asphalt. It was always in a dry condition and
carried very heavy traffic for ten years and was in a good
condition until about four years ago when it was removed
on account of widening the street. The bituminous pavement
on Michigan Boulevard is always clean and never
cleaned or sprinkled other than by patrol cleaning, except
as to narrow strips about four feet wide which are sprinkled
and hand broomed at night to remove the slight dust which
collects near the curb.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Bureau of Municipal Research of Milwaukee reports
that in that city 298 miles of street are sprinkled at
a cost of $60,310.05. Of this amount $55,104.77 is assessable.</p>

<p class='c000'>The balance is the city’s portion for public property and
street and alley sections which is charged to the general
city fund. The city used 275,498,112 gallons of water, costing
$28,416.65 including $8,800 for hydrant rental. The
average rate of assessment per foot front is about .017¢.
In some cities where water is unavailable outside of city
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>limits, or available only for a short time, oil has been used
to meet the demands for dust prevention. What seems to
be the best is some non-volatile oil that will quickly penetrate
the wearing surface of the road incorporating itself
with the fine particles so that it forms a dense, smooth,
waterproof coating, or else renders the surface dressing so
heavy that wind will not hold it in suspension in the air.
In addition to this its non-volatile character gives it lasting
qualities.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Milwaukee Bureau of Municipal Research believes
that “The service at its best is of no value as it does not
clean but only allays dust on the street where in its wet
condition it requires a further process of cleaning by the
squeegee or flusher and White Wings. If the city had a
sufficient amount of modern equipment to clean streets more
frequently, the valueless method of sprinkling could be
eliminated and an enormous expense saved.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In some cities street railway companies are required
to sprinkle between their tracks and for certain distances
on either side of the track. The legal question has several
times arisen, whether a Municipal corporation has authority
to enact an ordinance to compel railway companies to
sprinkle in this way and also whether the particular ordinance
in question is reasonable, or so unreasonable as to
be void. Generally speaking it has been decided that such
an ordinance must be specific, not burdensome, and confined
to the company’s tracks, though in one case in Massachusetts,
under the statutory powers conferred upon municipal
authority, an ordinance requiring sprinkling from
curb to curb was sustained. Courts have held that an ordinance
providing that “each and every Company or Corporation
operating street car lines within the limits of the city
of ——— shall water their tracks so as to effectually
keep the dust on the same laid,” and provides a penalty for
its violation, is neither indefinite nor wanting in uniformity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The question of sprinkling streets before sweeping has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>been discussed repeatedly. Following are the methods used
in some cities:</p>

<p class='c010'><em>New York.</em>—Sprinkling before machines. No sprinkling
before hand sweeping.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Chicago.</em>—Sprinkling before sweeping. The Chicago
Code of 1911 requires that street car companies shall
keep well sprinkled with water in a manner satisfactory
to the Commissioner of Public Works, all
streets on which they maintain and operate their
tracks. They are required to sprinkle such streets
twice each day. By another section such street car
companies shall clean such portions of streets as lie
between the two outermost rails of such tracks and
also every additional service as may be prescribed
in any railway ordinance relating to or affecting any
street.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Philadelphia.</em>—The proposals and specifications for the
cleaning of streets, roads, alleys, inlets and markets
for 1915, contained the following provision: In addition
to the cleaning by blockmen required under
these specifications, all streets must be periodically
cleaned by machines, the number of weekly cleanings
being given in the classification of streets, the remaining
machine work shall be done with machine
brooms immediately preceded by sprinklers.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>St. Louis.</em>—Sprinkling before sweeping is very rarely
done, except in the case of certain large sweeping
machines used by the city.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Baltimore.</em>—Sprinkles before sweeping.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Pittsburgh.</em>—Principal thoroughfares including all
streets in business district cleaned by machine sweepers.
Water cart precedes sweeping machine. The
cart must never be more than one block ahead of the
sweeper.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span><em>Washington.</em>—Superintendent of street cleaning gives
his opinion that much more effective sweeping can
be done without sprinkling and in hand patrol work
where dirt is not allowed to collect in any considerable
quantity is not necessary. In machine sweeping,
however, he finds it necessary to sprinkle with
a small amount of water. In cold weather sprinkling
is omitted; but at such times many complaints
are received on account of dust.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Minneapolis.</em>—In general the orders of the street district
commissioners are to sprinkle the streets before
sweeping.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Street Cleaning Methods</h3>

<p class='c017'>Four methods are used in American cities for street
cleaning, hand sweeping, machine sweeping, flushing by
machine and hose and squeegeeing.</p>

<p class='c000'>All experts advocate the sweeping of streets by hand,
commonly called the patrol system. The implements used
in patrol cleaning are broom, pan scraper, squeegees, can
carrier and cans. The broom is usually one which has a
4 × 18 inch block, filled with split bamboo, rattan, hickory,
steel wire or black African bass. The block is usually fitted
with a steel scraper. The pan scraper is constructed like
a dust pan, turned up sides and back. It is about 36 inches
wide by 15 inches deep. The squeegee is a board about 36
inches wide fitted with a rubber strip which extends below
the lower edge of the board. Brooms, pan scrapers and
squeegees have handles about 66 inches long. The cans
are made to hold about three cubic feet of dirt and taper
19 inches in diameter at the top to 17 inches at the bottom.
The can carrier has two large wheels and two small, and a
platform upon which the can or cans rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>A new carrier has been devised which carries two cans
and is so balanced that the two cans are more easily manipulated
than the one. Some cities are now substituting canvas
bags for cans.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Whinery says that when street surfaces are of such
character as to admit it, hand sweeping is the most effective
method.</p>

<p class='c000'>J. W. Paxton says that hand cleaning work is capable
of better distribution than any other method, because more
attention can be given to dirtier areas by increasing the
number of men who only clean the portions of the street
which are dirty and work on those portions until they are
clean. There is a fine scum which is not apparent when
the pavements are dry but rises up in a thin sheet of mud
when moist, making the pavements very slippery. This
and fine dust cannot be removed by hand cleaners, but by
washing about twice a week in addition to hand cleaning,
these troubles can be eliminated.</p>

<p class='c000'>Very believes that this method of cleaning is fairly effective
but is a dust raiser and the ability of the man to
cover areas is very limited, especially since the automobile
has come into such general use, as it interferes with the
sweeper and his work. He says that there are hand machine
brooms built on the principle of the carpet sweeper
which are not dust raisers and which as a matter of fact
do much more effective work. The pan scraper is only
valuable to remove manure and mud and coarse litter, and
its use should be limited to the time necessary for such
work, and the broom used for dust removal.</p>

<p class='c000'>The area a sweeper can clean depends upon the existence
of local conditions. A test was made in New York
City for one week and it was found that the area one
sweeper was able to clean in a day of eight hours varied
from 2,212 square yards to 16,075 square yards, with an
average over the whole city of 5,745 square yards. The
efficiency division of the Civil Service Commission of
Chicago reports: “From an analysis of the findings of the
time and motion studies of street cleaners the following
table has been deduced, upon which are based the relative
difficulty of cleaning different pavements under varying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>conditions and the standard and equivalent areas to be
cleaned by one man in one eight-hour day.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In Philadelphia, which cleans its streets by contract,
block men are assigned to sections designated by the chief.
The area to be covered depends upon the character and
amount of traffic. The duties of block men consist in
patrolling the areas, gathering all papers and refuse and
sweeping dirt as fast as it accumulates, and putting it into
dust proof bags ready for loading into special wagons and
hauling to a dumping station. The equipment used in hand
patrol work consists of hand machines, bag carrier, burlap
sacks, push brooms, hand scrapers, special cans and shovels.
The dirt collected is placed in sacks and left at convenient
points to be collected by special wagons and taken to the
dump in sacks, these being returned by the drivers. Sacks
are used in preference to cans because of the weight, bulk
and noisiness of the latter.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Machine Sweeping</h3>

<p class='c017'>Machine sweeping and cleaning is almost universally
condemned, although this method is used in many cities.
The machine broom is preceded by a sprinkling cart to
loosen the filth and in a measure to prevent the dust rising.
This is seldom effected. A broom is found to cover about
40,000 square yards per eight hours. The material is swept
into windrows at the side and finally delivered to a windrow
in the gutter, where it is picked up. The efficiency of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>rotary broom system is considerably reduced because the
sweepers meet continual obstructions in busy streets and
when operating over paved streets the brooms remove the
coarser fragments of dirt only and leave the finer particles
on the pavement.</p>

<p class='c000'>Where the rotary broom is preceded by a street sprinkler,
the dust forms into mud and clings to the surface of the
pavement, and where the pavement is rough the mud is
forced into the joints between paving blocks. As the street
becomes dry, the dirt pulverizes and appears again as a dust
nuisance. In all but one instance machine sweepers have
been dispensed with in Chicago. South Water Street, the
heavy wholesale fruit district of the city, is badly congested
during the day, which makes it impossible effectively to
clean this district by the “block” system. This street becomes
very dirty during the day and is covered with a thick
layer of dirt and débris at night. In this instance, the
broom machines appear to be effective and give fairly good
results in the cleaning of this coarse material.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Chicago Commission believes that the mixing of
calcium chloride with the water which is sprinkled in the
different sections of the city would greatly add to the effectiveness
of street cleaning and eliminating the perils of
dust.</p>

<p class='c000'>According to Very horse drawn brooms of the rotary
style are not as effective as the hand broom.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whinery says, “Sweeping by power sweepers at intervals
of one or more days, while less expensive is far less
effective and satisfactory than hand sweeping, though if
properly done and supplemented by sprinkling with water
or oil at intervals sufficiently near together to prevent dust
flying it serves a good purpose.”</p>

<p class='c000'>J. W. Paxton is of the opinion that the machine broom
raises so much dust that heavy sprinkling is required. The
fine dust mixed with water produces mud which is smeared
on the street by the broom and when this becomes dry it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>turns to dust again. The broom sweeps only the coarser
particles and many of these are thrown over the broom
by centrifugal force to the pavement again.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Philadelphia, machine broom cleaning is done in batteries
of two or three, preceded by sprinklers, the number
of brooms in each battery depending upon the width and
character of the streets to be cleaned. The average gang
consists of two machine brooms and one sprinkler, and four
to seven broomers and a sufficient supply of wagons to remove
the refuse, the number depending upon the haul to
the dump and season of year, together with amount and
character of traffic.</p>

<p class='c000'>An investigation made by the Milwaukee Bureau of
Municipal Research into the cost of rotary broom service
brought out the following facts: In industrial and outlying
residential section and upon streets adjacent to
wharfs, where pavements are constructed of brick, sandstone,
limestone or granite, the rotary brooms are usually
used. The process is done nightly and to prevent dust, a
sprinkler is used in advance of broom.</p>

  <h3 class='c008'>Pick-up Machines</h3>
</div>

<p class='c017'>To improve on machine sweeping various types of motor
pick-up machines have been invented. Most of them have
proved of no value. Some, however, are being used by
cities with good results on dry, smooth pavement in good
repair. Most experts question whether vacuum cleaning
will ever be able to remove effectively mud or wet dust.
Some experts, however, believe that these pick-up machines
will solve the problem of cleaning macadam pavements, as
it is the only method that can be employed without serious
results. These machines will travel at a rate of four miles
an hour, which exceeds the speed attained by any horsepower
sweeper.</p>

<p class='c000'>The experience of Oakland, Cal., with this method of
cleaning is interesting. Adjacent to the congested district
a suction sweeper had been used for several years. The
district had been swept from three to six times a week, by
contract, to the satisfaction of the city officials. The department
reports that the cost was rather high in comparison
with that for rotary sweeping, but that the results
were more satisfactory. It cost the city 35¢. per 1,000
square yards to clean with the suction sweeper and 26¢. per
1,000 square yards with the rotary brooms. It had been
generally assumed that the patrol system was the most expensive
until the Street Commissioner readjusted the routes
according to area and traffic. He then found that hand
sweeping could be done on streets not swept by rotary
brooms at the same cost or not to exceed a ten per cent. increase.
He found also that it could be done for much less
than cleaning by suction machines. The city has, therefore,
entirely superseded this method of cleaning at an
estimated annual saving of $3,000 and with much better
results.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomona, California, found that moisture upon the surface
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>of a pavement or in any form of refuse cannot be
lifted by a suction sweeper. Instead it is in effect smeared
over the surface of the street. In all cases where the street
is dry and the surface of the pavement is reasonably dry
the city has found the machine very positive in its operation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Los Angeles, California, is thoroughly testing the
vacuum method of street cleaning following a report by the
Efficiency Commission, which has estimated a saving of
$65,071 a year if the streets are swept with vacuum cleaners
instead of flushed. The report says that supplementary
observations and calculations show that the cost of flushing
under present conditions is 24.06¢. per 1,000 square yards,
and the cost of vacuum cleaning 10.96 cents per 1,000 square
yards. These figures include the cost of supervision, maintenance
of equipment, workman’s compensation, gutter
cleaning and water at cost of production. The cost of
operating one of these machines is given by the Milwaukee
Bureau of Municipal Research, as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>From personal observation it was calculated this machine
can operate at a speed of four miles per hour and perform
work at about 75 per cent. efficiency, or at a cost of
21.4¢. per 1,000 square yards.</p>

<p class='c000'>The assessment per front foot based on a street 30 feet
wide and cleaned 50 times a season would be 1.77 cents.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>Raymond W. Parlin, Deputy Commissioner Street
Cleaning, New York City, says: “So definite are the needs
of the cities for results better than those produced by sweeping
that it may be safely prophesied that sweeping in the
future will cease to be a primary method of cleaning a modern
city and will become an auxiliary to other more efficient
methods or used where only rough cleaning is desired.”</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Cleaning by Flushing</h3>

<p class='c017'>All authorities agree that whatever method for primary
cleaning is adopted, it is important that the street surface
be frequently washed by the use of hose, horse drawn flushers,
flushing cars, or power squeegees. Reports from cities
show that flushing is replacing machine sweeping and that
the automobile flusher is becoming popular. The Chief of
the Atlanta Sanitary Department favors doing away with
sweeping machine and cleaning the streets entirely with
flushing machines. He says that sweeping machines are
out of date and that flushers are the ideal machines.</p>

<p class='c000'>The squeegee is a vehicle having a tank and a revolving
rubber roller, which washes the pavement as the vehicle
moves along the street and the water from the tank is
sprinkled in front of the roller. Hose flushing is used in
cities having graded streets and sufficient water supply.
Street flushers have pressure tanks which depend for their
pressure either upon the pressure from the water mains
or upon the pressure obtained from a pump operated by
a gasoline engine. The latter plan gives the better results.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whinery is of the opinion that on well paved streets the
most efficient and satisfactory method so far devised with
the apparatus now available is hand cleaning by the patrol
system by day, followed with hose or flushing wagons or
scrubbing squeegees during the night. While this is somewhat
more expensive than plain machine sweeping he thinks
that no other method yet devised will produce equally clean
streets at a lower cost.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>Gustave H. Hanna says: “The use of flushers has
proven not only the cheapest but the most satisfactory
method of street cleaning that our experience in Cleveland
has been able to develop. Statistics of the department
show an average cost of 15.3 cents per square of 10,000
square feet for flushing to which must be added practically
9 cents for pick-up work, a total of some 24 cents per square
as against 42 cents for work with White Wings. The White
Wings are too convenient and necessary an adjunct to be
wholly displaced under any consideration. Down town
streets must be swept continually during the day and the
hand sweeper with his small cart can also work to advantage
in gutters of residential streets collecting dirt that has
either been flushed or blown to the curb; but so far as our
experience goes, the lessening of cleaning cost by cheaper
methods means simply the extension of the use of flushers at
every practical point.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is an argument of sanitation in favor of flushing.
Hand sweeping causes a certain amount of dust and
mechanical sweeping usually causes still more. I am opposed
to the use of simple sprinkling as a means of laying
dust. Ammonia and other products leach out of damp
manure and form a scum on the surface that is nearly impossible
to remove, and makes pavement slippery and foul
smelling.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Water should also be applied with force enough to
carry the refuse to gutter where it should be properly collected
with broom and shovel and removed. In Philadelphia
flushing machines are used only on poorly paved streets
and block pavement. High pressure flushing machines are
usually operated similarly.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Very reports that objection is made to flushing because
materials are washed into sewers. The same objection, he
says, might be made to hand sweeping, as many sweepers
are like housemaids and sweep the dust into the catch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>basins to make work easy. The material need not reach the
sewers if the operator knows his business. Many fear that
the action of water when used in flushing will wear away
the pavement surface or the joint materials. His answer
is that it should, if such a class of pavement or of jointing
is allowed to be laid, to expose the paving contractor.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Chicago Civil Service Commission says that personal
inquiry and analysis of reports from cities using flushing
machines seem to indicate that the use of flushing machines
on rough and smooth pavement and the use of squeegees
on smoother permanent pavements have given more effective
cleaning than the ordinary block or gang cleaning
where it is practicable to make the substitution.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Milwaukee Bureau of Municipal Research, in its investigation
of street cleaning in that city, says the contention
of some is that flushing is detrimental to pavement as
it removes grout, but such has not been proven in Milwaukee.
The one fact that remains uncontradicted is that they
clean the streets of every particle of débris and leave the
thoroughfares in a sanitary condition; a matter of most
vital importance.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Milwaukee night work is confined to two territories
comprising the heavy traffic and commercial territories and
each alternating night the streets are flushed. This requires
the use of four machines and they operate in a staggered
double formation, cleaning the entire area without a
return movement. When intersecting streets are encountered,
the two rear machines perform the work and then
return to the original function. A great deal more territory
is thus covered than if machines were paired and each
allotted a given area. Day work is performed in like manner
except that the remaining four machines are assigned
to outlying districts and confined thereto. The following is
the cost of operating machine flushers as computed by the
Bureau:</p>

<p class='c000'>In recommending the flushing process the Milwaukee
Bureau says that sprinkling will be greatly reduced, the
slippery surface of thoroughfares due to this valueless
method will no longer exist, and that a cleaner and more
sanitary condition will be the result.</p>

<p class='c000'>The experience of Scranton, Pa., with flushers is that in
going over the streets but once satisfactory results are not
obtained. The director of public works says that this has
also been found in other cities he has visited where flushers
are used. He has concluded that the only practical and
efficient way to clean streets is by the use of automobile
flushers, one to about one and a half minutes ahead of the
other, the first flusher dampening the horse droppings and
other material that may stick to the pavement, thus loosening
them, and the second flusher sweeping them into the
gutter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Birmingham, Alabama, reports that its experience has
been that a great saving and better results are obtained by
substituting street flushers for sprinklers and brooms.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some cities are having success with street railway
flushers, among them Cleveland, Scranton, Columbus and
New Bedford, Mass. Cleveland furnishes and maintains
the flusher cars, pays the cost of operating them, including
the wages of employees and the cost of power, but contributes
nothing toward fixed charges or for track maintenance
or renewal.</p>

<p class='c000'>Commissioner John T. Fetherston, of New York City,
reports that the Mack truck flushing machines which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>city put into use during the summer of 1917 are capable,
according to preliminary investigation, of cleaning from
100,000 to 120,000 square yards of street per machine per
eight hour shift, and that they will do the work with the
use of approximately 400 gallons of water per thousand
square yards.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Hose Flushing</h3>

<p class='c017'>There is a difference of opinion as to the efficiency of
flushing by hose. In Philadelphia all alleys and streets
whose width between curbs is too narrow to permit the use
of street brooms are cleaned once each week with hose.
When additional cleaning is necessary it is done with hand
brooms.</p>

<p class='c000'>Very says that hose flushing is ineffective and uneconomical,
and that water does not reach the pavement in
such manner as to give full effect and usually is doing no
work at all.</p>

<p class='c000'>One city report makes this comment: “Four or five
sweepers hold a hose and play it in some sections as though
the object were to wash away the asphalt block pavement
and car tracks. Target shooting, with a stream of water,
so-called flushing, will never supplant wetting and scrubbing.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Very also claims that water to be effective must reach
the pavement surface in a chisel shape and at a proper
angle to remove and carry off the filth. He says that no
man is properly constructed to hold the hose at a proper
angle with the pavement to obtain the best results for any
length of time. Commissioner Fetherston says New York’s
experience shows that a hose gang consisting of two men
is able to clean well from 23,000 to 25,000 square yards of
the dirtiest Belgian block pavement in eight hours, and will
clean upward of 30,000 square yards of smooth pavement
of modern granite block in the same time, using 2-inch
hose, which is that city’s standard size for use with its new
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>hose reels. The amount of water required to clean 1,000
square yards is approximately 1,000 gallons.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Cleaning by Squeegeeing</h3>

<p class='c017'>The squeegee method is used on smooth pavements. Batteries
of two and three squeegees are usually preceded by
sprinklers, which use as much water as possible without
flooding the pavement, while the squeegees use just enough
water to create a wash. The idea of sprinkling the pavement
is to soften the surface and enable the squeegee to
cleanse the street of slime as well as coarser material.
Squeegees are followed by men who sweep up windrows of
dirt into piles and a sufficient number of carts follow to
remove the dirt. In New York where no sprinkling cart
is used they average 50,000 square yards per machine per
day with the use of 200 gallons of water per one thousand
square yards. In Washington with a sprinkling cart they
get about 80,000 square yards per machine per day.</p>

<p class='c000'>Parlin says that squeegeeing produces very effective
results with a limited use of water on smooth pavements in
good repair.</p>

<p class='c000'>Very believes that squeegee machines have their value,
and if the sprinkler cart is used in advance better results
are obtained.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Milwaukee machines are in constant operation on
smooth surface pavements. In certain sections where
streets are exceptionally wide, three machines are used in
staggered formation and necessitate but one and one-half
complete trips over a street to perfect cleaning. They are
routed in such a manner that little idle travel is necessary
and filling plugs are specified to prevent empty haul to any
great extent. The same system is applied to territories
where only two machines can be operated, except that four
return trips are necessary to complete the work. In no
wise are operators allowed to confine their work within a
given block unless conditions prevent, but must continue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>until tanks are emptied, which usually occurs at end of
second block. Two laborers are employed with these machines
to keep gutters free from dirt and obstructing the
water from flowing to the catch basins.</p>

<p class='c000'>The average area cleaned in one year was 377,712 square
yards at a cost of $96.35 per day or 25.5 cents per 1,000
square yards. Of the total yardage of pavement in the city
1,105,324 square yards are free from car tracks and subject
to squeegee process. Some are squeegeed twice a week
while others are cleaned but once and each have the additional
service of White Wings and sprinkler.</p>

<p class='c000'>Manufacturers have placed on the market a modern
motor driven squeegee said to be efficient and economical
to a city with large area of smooth pavement. The capacity
of this tank is increased to 750 gallons (an increase of
200 gallons over horse-drawn machine), which will permit a
large area to be cleaned uninterrupted by constant filling,
and reduce the lost time at hydrants. There are two sets
of sprays, one directly in front of machine and one directly
in front of squeegee. Back of the first spray or sprinkler
head is a set of two brushes to loosen any hardened matter
that might not be subjected to the squeegee process.
By using this machine, the employment of laborers to continue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>the flow of water to catch basins is unnecessary, as
the discharge of water is sufficient to remove any slight
particles that are removed by the horse drawn equipment.
At the end of the season, the machine can be dismantled and
a box attached to make it available for other purposes.

<p class='c000'>Whinery says that while it is true that flushing methods,
if thoroughly used, do carry the removed dust into the
sewers or drains, which is regarded by many objectionable
and to clog the pipes, this might happen where the whole
of the street dirt, coarse and fine, is thus carried together
into the sewers. He does not know of any instances where
actual trouble has resulted. The practise of cleaning the
streets wholly by squeegeeing or flushing is not, however,
to be recommended, he believes, if for no other reason than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>that it would be impracticable to do the work several times
each day and thus prevent the formation and flying of dust.
The danger of clogging the sewers by flushing dust only
into them is, he thinks, very remote, as the quantity of the
dust remaining after proper coarse cleaning is small.
Careful determination by the New York Commission on
Street Cleaning and Waste Disposal showed that on smooth
pavements cleaned by the patrol system the accumulation
of dust in 48 hours after the street has been washed either
by hard rains or by flushing, does not exceed five per cent.
or six per cent. of the total daily quantity of street dirt,
though on rough stone block pavement it may be much
larger. This quantity is so small that its disposal through
the sewers could hardly cause serious trouble. In fact, the
large volume of water used tends rather to flush and clean
out the sewers.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a paper read before the American Society of Municipal
Improvements, Mr. Parlin summarizes as follows
the results of a study made by him to determine the economy
of the various types of flushing equipment: “Hose
flushing on small areas was the most economical method;
that up to 40,000 square yards, the horse drawn equipment
was next in economy; that from 40,000 square yards to
90,000 square yards the hose was about as economical as
the automobile; that from 90,000 square yards to 120,000
square yards automobile was supreme, and for daily
schedule areas of over 120,000 square yards the automobile
and street car equipment give nearly the same
economy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The street washing equipment of the future will probably
be a combination affair. This has been used in Europe
for several years. New York City is now developing combination
equipment.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ideal system of street cleaning would, therefore, be
efficient patrol or hand cleaning through the day or during
a longer period if the volume of travel in the evening requires
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>it, and thorough scrubbing with squeegees or washing
with water under pressure by flushing machines or
hose at night as often as may be necessary.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although the automobile equipment has not been in use
long, experience has shown that it is both efficient and
economical, particularly in the larger cities.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Disposal of Street Refuse</h3>

<p class='c017'>In most cities the final disposal of sweepings and waste
collected from the streets is a troublesome problem, and the
cost is no small item in the expenses of the street cleaning
department. The majority dispose of the sweepings on
city dumps. A few cities are able to dispose of a part of
the sweepings from paved streets to farmers and gardeners
in the near vicinity on terms that repay at least a part of
the cost that would otherwise have to be incurred, but the
expense of handling and transporting the material to any
considerable distance and its great bulk compared with its
commercial value as a fertilizer place a limit on its disposal
in this way. Nevertheless, it should be possible in the
smaller cities at least to interest farmers and gardeners in
the use of this material to a greater extent than is now common
and to dispose thus of the sweepings at a price that
would reduce the cost of disposal otherwise. The use of
street refuse for filling low ground or reclaiming areas of
shallow water and marshes has not been so seriously considered
as it should be.</p>

<p class='c000'>In some cities the street dirt is used as a fill between
sidewalks and curb or in low alleys and vacant lots which
are adjacent to the streets cleaned.</p>

<p class='c000'>In other cities where the so-called “short haul” system
is used, the street dirt is collected from stations at which
the street sweepers deposit it, for filling purposes within
the ward. The haul seldom exceeds three-quarters of a
mile. One mile has been used as a standard for short hauls
within wards.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>
  <h3 class='c008'>Relative Cost of Street Cleaning</h3>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Most experts agree that little can be gained by comparing
unit costs in different cities as local conditions and
prices paid for labor, etc., vary so widely. Another reason
is the lack of uniformity in standards and records maintained
in the various cities. And still another reason is the
varying standards of cleanliness. Very few cities in considering
the sum to be appropriated first determine the
standard of cleanliness to be attained. An investigation
conducted by the United States Bureau of Census indicated
that the unit cost of street cleaning in cities having less than
300,000 inhabitants is less than that in cities having over
300,000.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the many different methods of record and cost
keeping are considered as well as the difficulties encountered
in obtaining accurate information as to conditions and
methods used in the cleaning of streets, the reasons for these
differences are apparent.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>The Municipal Journal</cite> in January, 1915, printed a table
which shows that the average number of cleanings per year
in thirty-one of the largest cities was 156, varying from
37½ to 300. The cubic yards of sweepings per year per
thousand square yards of street area averaged 20.5, varying
from 5.7 to 48; the latter being in Boston and nearly four
times that reported from Washington. The average amount
of sweepings collected at each cleaning was 191 cubic yards
per million square yards cleaned, varying from 32 to
440. The cost per thousand square yards of cleaning done
averaged 35½ cents, varying from 14 cents to $1.53. The
cost per cubic yard of sweepings averaged $2.70, varying
from 79 cents to $8.75.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>SEWAGE DISPOSAL<br /> <span class='large'>EFFICIENCY OF PROCESSES USED BY AMERICAN CITIES—OPINIONS OF AUTHORITIES—EXPERIMENTS WITH NEW METHODS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Recognition of the necessity for the proper disposal
of sewage is now quite prevalent in most American communities,
whether large or small. In many sections the
problem has become vital, and as the population increases,
it is only a matter of time when all will be compelled to
solve the problem, for its importance grows in direct
proportion to the rapid increase in inhabitants. The continued
concentration of population makes it increasingly
difficult and expensive for a municipality to secure and
maintain a pure water supply and forces community activity
for protection against disease germs. It also causes
the demand for the improvement of the esthetic condition
of bodies of water within or near a city’s boundaries. Many
states have already recognized the conditions due to these
nuisances and have enacted strict legislation with a view to
preventing the pollution of streams and other bodies of
water, for the protection of water supplies, surface and
underground, and for the elimination of disease germs accompanying
sewage. States and even nations have realized
that sewage disposal is more than a local problem. In
every case it is an inter-community problem, in some it is
inter-state and in a few the question must be settled by
national governments.</p>

<p class='c000'>Even those communities which have not already provided
a proper method of disposal of their sewage know
that it must be done sooner or later, and many are preparing
for it either by making a preliminary study, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>preparing tentative plans, by reconstructing their sewerage
systems or planning new extensions with that end in view,
or by shaping their financial programs so that the community
will be prepared to assume the financial burden
when the necessity becomes imperative.</p>

<p class='c000'>The quantity of harmful waste produced by a community
is surprisingly small in comparison with the disastrous
effects it may produce. All authorities agree that in cities
provided with an abundant water supply sewage contains
less than one-tenth of one per cent. of foreign substances.
This organic matter and the products of its decomposition
the Massachusetts State Board of Health has found rarely
exceed one-half of one per cent. of the sewage. George W.
Fuller, consulting sanitary engineer, says that 99.9 per
cent. of sewage is ordinarily pure water and that even much
of the remainder is harmless matter of a mineral nature.
The experience of George S. Webster, Chief Engineer of
the Bureau of Surveys and of the Philadelphia Sewage
Testing Station, with sewage works, indicates that on an
average 1,000 persons produce per annum forty-five tons
of dry sludge matter, or the solid part of the sewage after
treatment; and the United States Census Bureau reports
that the volume of sewage discharged daily during the year
per person is 164 gallons. Yet the small amount of decomposing
matter must be properly treated for it is that
which gives sewage its offensive character and power to
cause disease.</p>

<p class='c000'>The proper solution of the sewage disposal problem involves
first, the construction of a sewerage system that will
remove the sewage from the community completely and as
rapidly as possible, and secondly, the construction of a disposal
plant at which the sewage can be treated in such a
way that when it is discharged into the body of water it
will not cause a nuisance and disease.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>
  <h3 class='c008'>The Sewerage System</h3>
</div>

<p class='c017'>There are two types of sewerage systems in use, the
separate and the combined. In the former the storm water
is removed in one set of pipes and the domestic sewage in
another. The combined system removes both in the same
set of pipes. In deciding which system to adopt three factors
must be first considered, the cost, the topography of
the city and the method of disposal. The general conclusions
of sanitary engineers at present regarding the relative
merits of the two systems are that either is satisfactory
from a sanitary point of view when properly constructed,
that the separate system is usually best for suburban districts
not closely built up and for all communities where
the sanitary sewage requires treatment, and that often a
combination of the two systems can be used to advantage.
Most engineers point to the advantage of combined sewers
in narrow streets and congested districts where only one
pipe and one house connection are required.</p>

<p class='c000'>The belief has been expressed by John H. Gregory, consulting
engineer, that as a general proposition the cost of
building a combined system is less than that of constructing
a separate system, especially where the territory to be served
is more or less closely built up and streets paved. In suburban
territory, not closely built up and where storm
water is easily and quickly diverted into natural water
courses, he believes the separate system will in general cost
less, for then only sanitary sewers need to be built first,
the storm water sewers being deferred for years or only
such drains constructed as are immediately required. When
there are steep grades and relatively high velocity all authorities
agree with Gregory that it is advisable to build
combined sewers, even though the development of the territory
may hardly be such as to require the removal of the
storm water.</p>

<p class='c000'>Discussing the merits of the two systems so far as they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>affect the cost of disposal Clark P. Collins, sanitary engineer,
concludes that generally speaking “it is unwise to
dilute sewage with storm water and to befoul storm water
with sewage in the attempt to remove both by the same
underground channel.” Gregory has expressed the opinion
that if sewage is to be discharged into a body without
treatment the combined system will offer the simplest and
cheapest solution of the problem.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the principal objections to the combined system
when the sewage is treated are the increase it causes in
the volume of liquid which necessarily requires a larger
plant and expenditure, the changes it causes in the character
of the sewage which complicates operation of the
plant, and the frequency with which it causes the flow of
sewage to exceed the maximum of the plant, thereby making
it necessary to discharge untreated sewage into the
stream. With a combined system all kinds of trade wastes
must be run through the disposal plant, whether they are
offensive or not; automatic devices, which should be avoided
whenever possible, are necessary between the combined
and intercepting sewers to limit the amount of flow; a
greater amount of grit is deposited at the disposal works
unless in the separate system the first wash of the street is
intercepted. The New York State Board of Health advocates
the separate system.</p>

<p class='c000'>In constructing, extending or reconstructing a sewerage
system it is well to bear in mind that even though a city has
not at present a disposal plant, the time will come in all
probability when increased population will compel the treatment
of its sewage by some process. It may, therefore, be
more economical eventually to make present plans so that
when disposal does come the sewerage system will make
possible the most economical operation of the disposal
works. Gregory’s conclusion as recently expressed in an
address is that “other things being equal, especially as more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>and more attention is being given to sewage disposal, the
separate system seems to offer greater advantages.”</p>

<p class='c000'>All engineers advocate good ventilation for sewers and
gradients that will develop self-cleansing velocities, so as
to reduce gas trouble and to deliver the sewage as fresh as
possible to the disposal works. The best practise, according
to reports of the State Boards of Health, show that these
velocities should be not less than two feet per second in
separate systems and two and one-half feet in combined
systems. In some instances where it has been necessary to
reduce the gradients because of the expense of obtaining
steeper ones, a velocity of one foot per second has been found
to be satisfactory; but in such instances sewers must be well
constructed and flushed. Most trade wastes require a
higher velocity to prevent deposits.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>The Degree of Purification of Sewage</h3>

<p class='c017'>Before determining the proper method of disposal the
first point to be settled by a city is the degree of purification
desired or needed for both the present and the future. The
decision is dependent upon three factors: the self-purifying
capacity of the stream or body of water into which the
effluent—liquid portions of the sewage run off after treatment—is
to be discharged and its utilization for water supply,
bathing, etc., the character and amount of the sewage
and the possible future growth not only of the city itself,
but also of the communities bordering on the stream. While
there have been some demands for the absolute sterilization
of sewage, many sanitarians believe that any artificial
method of sewage treatment will not esthetically render
the final effluent fit for ingestion, and practically all authorities
agree that final discharge of sewage need not be in this
perfect condition. This seems to be based on logical reasoning
when one considers that all waterways are necessarily
polluted to some extent. John Duncan Watson, of
Birmingham, England, contends that the complete elimination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>of bacteria is prohibitive inasmuch as it is beyond the
limits of the reasonable demands on the purse. Robert
Spurr Weston, member of the American Society of Civil
Engineers, at one time reminded an audience that the
proper place to protect the water consumers against disease
is at the water works and not at the sewage disposal plant.
Authorities are in general agreed that sewage should be disposed
of as the stream demands, and that local conditions
should determine degree of purification required. Standards
of purity have been studied by many societies and various
suggestions have been made. All agree that the sewage
after treatment should not deteriorate the stream into which
it flows. Watson advocates under certain conditions an
effluent that will not putrefy on being kept for seven days
at a uniform temperature of 80 degrees F. and that does
not contain more than three parts per 100,000 of suspended
solid matter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Generally speaking the suspended matter should be removed,
the conditions near the point of discharge be inoffensive
and the water be not impaired for purposes of
manufacture and pleasure. When a city is located on the
seashore or near a large lake or stream the screening out
of the heavy particles before the sewage is discharged together
with dilution will prevent active decomposition and
putrefaction of the sewage the body of water receives and
the esthetic senses of the community will not be offended.
On small bodies of water and when the water is used for
drinking and manufacturing purposes or for bathing or
shellfish the conditions usually demand not only a non-putrescible
effluent but also one that is free from harmful
bacteria or one that is highly purified like that from sand
filters.</p>

<p class='c000'>There seems to be a general agreement among sanitary
engineers that the condition of the river below where the
effluent joins it is a safe guide and should be the ruling
factor in determining the degree of purification desirable.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Authorities, however, are not agreed as to whether the standard
of cleanliness should be based solely on chemical analysis
or on a mixed standard taking into consideration the
appearance of the water and its physical, chemical and bacterial
conditions, as has been demonstrated by the Metropolitan
Sewage Commission of New York. One expert in
answer to the question propounded by the Commission
based the standard solely on chemical analysis, but none
of those whose views were sought was willing to accept the
dissolved oxygen test as an all sufficient criterion of the
condition of the water. One considered that the oxygen
should be regarded as a reliable index of the cleanliness of
the water only when dealing with the condition of gross
pollution and only when in conjunction with observations
of the appearance and physical conditions of the water.
One of them would not have a standard of cleanliness based
solely upon analysis of any kind and all were agreed that
the standard of cleanliness should not rest upon the effect
of the polluted water upon health.</p>

<p class='c000'>After having decided on the degree of purification the
next step in the solution of the problem is to select the
process of treatment best adapted with local conditions to
produce the results at the lowest cost and without nuisance.
No specific rules can be laid down for the selection of the
best process for all communities. Domestic wastes offer
the least difficulty, but they are usually complicated with
the presence of trade or street wastes or both. Features
difficult to overcome may then be produced. Then also, the
character of the sewage varies greatly with the season, days
and even hours. This is due to the habits of the people, to
climatic conditions and to the amount and character of trade
and industrial wastes and to the amount of water used
and allowed to infiltrate. A cannery, creamery, tannery,
brewery, strawboard factory, wool scouring shop, dyeing
and cleaning works may discharge its wastes so that during
a certain period the character of the sewage be entirely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>changed. Knowledge of these conditions and changes are
necessary to plan a successful disposal plant. Each community
has its own problem, and while there are certain
general conditions that should be considered, each case is
more or less unique. Charles G. Hyde, consulting engineer
of the California State Board of Health, has summed up
the situation in this statement: “It is folly to suppose that
because one town can dispose of its sewage successfully
in some certain fashion, another town can adopt the same
method with a certainty of securing equally satisfactory results.
Sewage differs widely in character, not only as between
towns but in a given town.”</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Processes of Treatment</h3>

<p class='c017'>The processes for treating sewage may be divided into
three main groups—the preliminary or preparatory, the
main or final, and disinfection.</p>

<p class='c000'>The processes in the preliminary or preparatory group
remove more or less of the solids, especially the suspended
matter, but the effluent, or liquid that is discharged into
the stream, is chemically unstable and will decompose and
putrefy. These are the simplest methods of treatment, and,
except when sewage is discharged into very large bodies of
water where it is desired only to improve the esthetic condition
or where the water is capable of rapid self-purification,
at least one of these processes is used in combination
with some other form of treatment in the next group. The
preliminary processes are dilution, screening (coarse or
fine), plain sedimentation, straining or roughing filters,
chemical precipitation, slate beds, colloidal tanks, septic
tank treatment, and single contact beds.</p>

<p class='c000'>The main or final processes are more complex. These
remove a substantial proportion of the dissolved and suspended
matter. The effluent is generally stable. When
any one of these processes is used it is customary to provide
some preliminary treatment. The processes in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>group are double contact beds, trickling (also called percolating),
sprinkling filters, intermittent sand filtration and
broad irrigation or sewage farming.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the third group is the process of disinfection, either
by hypo-chlorite of lime or liquid chlorine. Some authorities
call this third group the finishing process and preface
two others, secondary settling tanks and secondary filters.
The chemical elements of this group destroy the bacteria,
especially the disease producing kind, and are used in combination
with one or more of the processes in the other two
groups to produce a highly purified effluent.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several other processes have been developed within the
last few years. The electrolytic process is now being used
in a few American cities, and has been included in almost all
of the experiments now being made by municipalities. The
activated sludge process has been adopted by two large
cities, Milwaukee, Wis., and Houston, Texas, and two small
cities, San Marcos, Texas, and Escanaba, Mich., and is
being tested in at least eighteen others, among them Baltimore,
Cleveland and Brooklyn. Jersey City, N. J., has tentatively
adopted the activated sludge process. Another process,
known as the Miles Acid Sludge Process, is being
experimented with by the city of Boston.</p>

<p class='c000'>These processes or variations of them may be used singly
or in combinations of two or more to yield different degrees
of purification that will meet varying local requirements.
Which of these or what combination of processes to use
according to local requirements is the all important question
for a city to answer. Several cities either have adopted
or are planning to adopt the plan advocated by John A.
Giles, Commissioner of Public Works of Binghamton, New
York, to include a number of the different stages of treatment
in the original design so that when future installation
is necessary on account of increased population, with its
increased pollution, or the need for a greater degree of
purification becomes imperative, the addition can be made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>on the site already provided for and each unit will fit into
the complete structure at a minimum cost. The consensus
of opinion is that a disposal works can be designed and
constructed which will produce an effluent that will not
deteriorate the water into which it is discharged, that will
create no nuisance from odor or from flies and that the cost
will be strictly proportionate to the sanitary and esthetic
results achieved.</p>

<p class='c000'>An approximate idea of the efficiency of the various
well known processes in the removal of bacteria was given
by Professor George G. Whipple, Professor of Sanitary
Engineering, Harvard University, before the New York
State Conference of Mayors and Other City Officials:</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Dilution</h3>

<p class='c017'>Comparatively few cities can much longer depend upon
large bodies of water to dilute their untreated sewage.
Even those cities located on the seacoast and on the banks
of large rivers and lakes have either provided some method
of treatment, usually one or more of the processes in the
preliminary group, or are planning to do so. New York
City which has an adjacent large body of water into which
it discharges its sewage without treatment of any kind, now
finds it necessary to adopt a combination of processes to
eliminate the nuisance the waste is causing. In some places
where dilution is depended upon, the existing nuisances
have been caused by the outlets being extended only to the
high water line of the water course, thus preventing a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>proper mixture of sewage with a sufficient volume of water
adequately to dilute it. Other difficulties experienced when
untreated or raw sewage is discharged into large volumes
of water in excessive quantities are the formation of deposits
of sludge, the residue after sewage has been allowed
to settle, on the banks and the bottom; turbidity, milkiness
and oiliness of the water, bad odors, the formation of scum
upon the water and the destruction of shellfish. To overcome
these difficulties some cities have resorted to dredging,
screening and sedimentation. Others have been compelled
to adopt some more complicated process.</p>

<p class='c000'>The California State Board of Health in one of its bulletins
quotes its consulting engineer, Charles G. Hyde, as
saying that experience has demonstrated rather definitely
that a nuisance will be caused if sewage is diluted with less
than about twenty volumes of water while from forty to
fifty may in some cases be necessary. Weston believes that
in ordinary cases mixtures of sewage and water should be
fifty per cent. saturated with oxygen, and when there is an
excessive deposit of sludge even seventy per cent. of saturation
may be insufficient. Herring and Gregory, in their
report on the Albany, New York, system, say: “From observations
made in many rivers it has been found that a
flow of well oxygenated river water of from three to six
cubic feet per second is capable of diluting the sewage from
a population of 1,000 to a degree that will allow oxygen
in the river water to oxidize the easily putrescible organic
matter in the sewage and thereby prevent the water from
becoming offensive, provided the velocity of flow is sufficient
to prevent accumulations of sewage sludge on the bottom
of the stream.”</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Screening</h3>

<p class='c017'>The screening process consists of running the sewage
through coarse or fine screens, either hand cleaned or mechanically
operated, to remove suspended and floating matter.
There is almost an unanimity of opinion now in favor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>of the use of mechanically operated fine screens. The efficiency
depends largely although not entirely, upon the size
of the mesh or openings through which the sewage passes.
Coarse screens, which are cleaned by hand, will remove
from two to ten per cent. of the suspended matter and fine
screens which are mechanically operated will in some cases
remove as much as 25 per cent. Screening will not materially
change the turbidity of the liquid or the greasy appearance
nor will it remove all of the suspended matter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Experience has shown that the screening process is
valuable in connection with sewage pumping works and
inverted siphons, when sewage is disposed of by dilution
and when raw sewage is applied without any other preliminary
treatment to a final process as it prevents the clogging
of machinery and filters.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the process is used the screenings must ordinarily
be disposed of within twenty-four hours on account of fermentation
and decomposition which sets in quickly. In
some cities the deposits are buried and in others they are
burned after having been artificially dried. Robert Spurr
Weston says that it seems unwise to attempt to dispose
separately of two kinds of sludge, namely that removed
before and that remaining after subsidence. “On the other
hand,” he continues, “the screening of the effluent from a
settling tank in order to reduce the operative charges for
cleaning sprinklers is an economical practise. Furthermore,
the actual amount of material screened from the effluent
is small in comparison with that removed from unsettled
sewage and its subsequent disposal is not a serious
burden.”</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Grit Chambers</h3>

<p class='c017'>If a sewage disposal plant is operated in connection
with a combined sewerage system grit chambers are usually
necessary for the removal of sand, gravel and dirt before
the sewage passes on for further treatment. Where a city
has a separate system of sewerage grit chambers are held by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>some authorities to be unnecessary unless the first wash of
the street after a storm is intercepted and the waste is
treated. Gregory has expressed the belief that the safest
plan under ordinary conditions seems to be to provide a
grit chamber. It is generally agreed that the chambers
should be so constructed that the sewage will flow through
slowly enough for the grit to settle out, but fast enough to
carry the organic matter in suspension. To insure proper
operation the chamber must be cleaned out frequently. At
the Cleveland Sewage Testing Station it has been found
that velocities ranging from 30 to 60 feet per minute produce
a grit of proper character. The California State
Board of Health has advocated chambers with a capacity
such that a net period of storage of at least three minutes
be allowed and a velocity of not less than five feet per
minute.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Straining or Roughing</h3>

<p class='c017'>There are few cities which treat their sewage by the
process of straining and roughing. This consists of removing
the suspended matter by means of rapid straining
through beds of coke or sand arranged like the rapid sand
or mechanical water filter. Coke beds, especially in cold
climates, have not been a success. The chief objection to
the rapid sand filter is the wash water which contains much
organic or mineral impurities of the sewage and which
requires special treatment which experience has shown to
be difficult and expensive. Difficulty has also been found
in disposing of the sludge deposited upon the filter surface.
Of this process the bulletin of the California State Board
of Health says: “The process is an expensive one at best,
both as respects construction and operation. The effluent
from such works can be made fully equal to, if not better
than the effluent of plain sedimentation basins from a sanitary
point of view.” The experience of the Cleveland Testing
Station with these filters was not favorable. The filters
when operated at rates from 30 to 60 gallons per acre per
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>24 hours removed from 25 to 40 per cent. of suspended matter
and their action was simply mechanical, there being no
increase in the dissolved oxygen content. The report from
the station says that the difficulties encountered in their
operation were sufficient to eliminate the process as a
method in itself or in combination with other processes.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Treatment in Tanks</h3>

<p class='c017'>The treatment of sewage in tanks, either by chemical
or biological processes, has been adopted by many cities,
especially as a preliminary treatment. These processes are
known as plain sedimentation, chemical precipitation and
the septic process. Of these the treatment in the Imhoff
tank is the most popular at the present time.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Plain Sedimentation</h3>

<p class='c017'>By allowing the sewage either to flow into properly constructed
tanks or through them at a velocity low enough
to allow some of the suspended matter to separate from the
liquid and to be deposited on the bottom from which the
sludge is removed, is another process that has been used
by a number of American and European cities. The first
tanks were constructed so that they could be filled with
sewage and then after the suspended matter had settled the
effluent was drawn off. This was known as the fill and draw
plan. Later what is now known as the continuous flow
principle was used. The velocity of the flowing sewage
is reduced sufficiently as it enters and passes through the
tank for the suspended matter to settle. The sludge which
collects at the bottom of the tank must be removed frequently.
The results are affected by the quantity and quality
of the sewage, fresh sewage being capable of greater
clarification by sedimentation than stale sewage. The range
in storage period for American sewages is from four to
twelve hours and the removal of suspended matter is from
45 to 75 per cent.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>In some cities plain sedimentation has been used in connection
with dilution and in others as an aid to filtration.
The chief objection to the process is the sludge which is
extremely offensive and must be treated separately. It
does not dry readily, is difficult to handle and if allowed to
accumulate causes serious nuisance. Because of these difficulties
and the fact that the sludge from the Cameron and
Imhoff tanks can be more easily disposed of the septic
process has gradually forced plain sedimentation into the
background.</p>

<p class='c000'>Colloidal tanks were designed to carry the process of
clarification further than plain sedimentation, but they
have not come into general use. Metcalf and Eddy in their
“American Sewerage Practice” say of this process: “There
has been a feeling that while under some conditions a portion
of the colloidal solids could be removed by such devices,
the work accomplished was not likely to be sufficient to
offset the expense of construction and some difficulties in
operation.”</p>

<h3 class='c008'>The Septic Process</h3>

<p class='c017'>In the septic process the raw sewage is conveyed to
tanks, and allowed to stand until the solids have settled to
the bottom and have been partially destroyed or liquefied
by bacterial action. Two types of tanks are used in the
septic process, one known as the Cameron type and the other
as the Emscher or Imhoff tank.</p>

<p class='c000'>The best constructed Cameron tanks are not less than
8 feet in depth and are usually large enough to hold about
six hours’ maximum flow of sewage. The desirable time of
detention depends upon the character of the sewage, both as
to strength and freshness, strong and stale sewages demanding
a longer period. The tanks are usually built with baffles
at the entrance to retard the current and to deflect the
suspended matter to the bottom which is so constructed that
the sludge, after bacterial action has taken place, can be
drawn off from time to time.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>H. W. Clark, formerly chemist of the Massachusetts
State Board of Health, has expressed the belief that the rate
of flow through a septic tank should not be greater than that
which will cause passage in twelve hours.</p>

<p class='c000'>Charles G. Hyde in the California Board of Health Bulletin
says that as a rule the period should not be greater
than 24 hours nor less than 12 hours, except possibly with
weak or stale sewages. He advocates multiple units so
that the storage periods may be controlled to give optimum
results.</p>

<p class='c000'>The effluent which is turbid, putrescible and rich in
organic matter cannot be discharged into streams with
safety without further treatment, unless the volume of
water is sufficient to complete the purification by dilution.
As the solids settle a scum which forms on top of the tank,
keeps out light and air and produces a condition favorable
for the bacterial activity caused by minute organisms
known as anaerobic bacteria. These germs thrive and
functionate best in the absence of oxygen, and their chief
function in sewage treatment is the conversion of the solid
organic matter into a soluble form, somewhat less complex
in chemical composition. The sludge is rotted and when
full bacterial action has taken place is humified. In plain
sedimentation the solids are simply deposited upon the
bottom of the tank and are removed practically unchanged.
In the septic tank, however, a part of the solids after settling
are broken down or digested, thus somewhat lessening
the difficulty of disposing of the sludge.</p>

<p class='c000'>Reports vary widely as to the amount of suspended matter
that can be removed by the septic process. The Iowa
State College bulletin says that the amount of purification
does not usually exceed 25 to 40 per cent. Professor Whipple
places the removal between 60 and 70 per cent., and the
State Board of Health of California says it may vary
between 35 per cent. and 85 per cent., averaging perhaps 50
to 60 per cent. H. W. Clark places the amount at not less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>than 40 per cent. and adds that it will vary according to the
character of the sewage, the variations being from 30 per
cent. with weak sewage to 80 per cent. with strong sewage.</p>

<p class='c000'>All reports concur that in many cases the Cameron type
of tank has failed to produce efficient results. Among the
objections raised by authorities are the following:</p>

<p class='c000'>The sludge is not thoroughly digested and is somewhat
offensive. The odor is obnoxious and the effluent is too
stale and is treated with difficulty by oxidation processes.
Gilbert J. Fowler, Sanitary Expert of England, says the
defects which have shown themselves are a nuisance both
from the tank effluent and the sludge and an excessive quantity
of suspended solids in the tank effluent. Charles G.
Hyde believes a review of the principles and results of
operation appear to justify the conclusion that “the septic
effluents are only less dangerous than crude sewage to the
extent of efficiency of removal of organic matter.”</p>

<h3 class='c008'>The Imhoff Tank</h3>

<p class='c017'>In an effort to overcome the defects in the Cameron
tank, the Imhoff or Emscher tank was developed and this
now seems to have the preference among cities making new
installations. The tank consists of two compartments, one
above the other. It has a smaller area than the ordinary
septic tank, but is much deeper. The sewage passes at a
low velocity through the upper chamber, which is comparatively
shallow and V-shaped, the sides being sufficiently
steep to allow the solids to be deposited at the bottom of the
V which is equipped with slots. Through these the solids
pass into the second chamber below which is much deeper
than the other. The inclined partition wall must be cleaned
frequently with hose or squeegee in such a way as not to
clog the slots. The floating pieces of wood and cork must
be skimmed off, but the greater part of the suspended matter
that floats will generally sink after a time. Dr. Karl
Imhoff, the inventor of the tank, advises spraying with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>hose to expedite the sinking. Care must be taken to keep
the sides clean and the sludge in the lower tank below the
slot level. If neglected suspended matters will rise to the
surface behind as well as in front of the scum boards. Dr.
Imhoff advises the reversal of the flow of sewage about
every three weeks after skimming off the floating matter
when one sedimentation chamber feeds more than one
sludge chamber. The rate of flow in the upper chamber is
sufficiently rapid to prevent any septic action, yet slow
enough to allow much of the suspended matter to settle.</p>

<p class='c000'>The effluent in a comparatively fresh condition passes
out of the tank for further treatment or for discharge into
water courses. It therefore does not become stale nor does
it come in contact with decomposing sludge, thus eliminating
in part the objections advanced by authorities against
the Cameron tank.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the lower tank the sludge, after passing through the
slots is slowly digested through septic and other actions
without any disturbance by the flow of the liquid sewage,
above. Before the tank can deliver good, well digested
sludge—that is, a black alkaline odorless sludge—it must
be inoculated with a proper amount of good sludge, or the
raw sludge must be permitted to “ripen.” Dr. Imhoff has
found that even without inoculation a tank will discharge
good sludge from the beginning if ripe sludge is emptied
into the system from cesspools which have been in use a
long time.</p>

<p class='c000'>In some instances cities have had considerable trouble
with acid decomposition during the ripening period. This
produces a sludge of objectionable odor and one not easily
dried. It decomposes very slowly and may rise in a mass
to the surface of the sludge chamber. Various remedies
have been suggested, among them the addition of lime. “I
cannot advise such addition,” Dr. Imhoff has written. “All
plants which are known to me and in which acid decomposition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>has occurred have sooner or later adjusted themselves
of their own accord.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When properly inoculated the particles of sludge rise
and fall constantly in the process of giving off the gases.
The fresh sludge particles entering the chamber through
the slot are covered so that the entire mass becomes thoroughly
mixed and the untreated sludge in a short time is
inoculated with the proper organisms. The decomposed
sludge is discharged from time to time through pipes leading
from the bottom of the tank to drying beds.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Imhoff has advocated the discharge of sludge from
each sludge chamber once every two to six weeks, that the
optimum of the sludge level should be about three feet below
the slot level and if it is desired to promote the early
incidence of proper decomposition the sludge should not be
allowed to remain quiet at the bottom of the sludge chamber.
He advocates constant stirring and a uniform introduction
of fresh organic matter and the discharge of
the decomposed matter. The scum layer, he says, must be
agitated frequently by a jet of water or otherwise and the
sludge at the bottom of the chamber should be agitated by
a water stirring system. As a substitute, he suggests that
the whole body of sludge be pumped out and returned. To
determine the elevation of the sludge surface, he advises
lowering into the sludge chamber a very thin piece of sheet
iron one foot square in area held in a horizontal position.
If the level is too high, there will be gas bubbles on the surface
of the settling chamber above the slot or there will be
floating sludge and in extreme cases foaming sludge. As
compared with other tank processes the experience of cities
indicates that the Imhoff type has many advantages. Certain
inherent difficulties, however, have been pointed out
in several reports. Gilbert J. Fowler has expressed the
belief that “the comparative short time of settlement means
that variations in the character of the sewage must be quickly
reflected in the character of the tank effluence and that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>the filters (when they are used for further treatment) must
be called upon rapidly to accommodate themselves to fluctuating
conditions.” He believes that this is not conducive
to the development of the most efficient bacterial activity.
Storm water above moderate dilution, he says, will have
to receive separate treatment and he is of the opinion that
ordinary stand-by tanks will still be necessary for this
purpose, the sludge from which will have to be dealt with.
From the results of the operation of an experimental plant
in Worcester, Massachusetts, Matthew Gault, Superintendent
of Sewers, draws these conclusions: “It appears to be
perfectly feasible to treat Worcester sewage by means of
Imhoff tanks and sprinkling filters. The results of experimental
treatment of the effluent from chemical precipitation
tanks indicated that the advantages gained by
chemical precipitation as a preliminary treatment were not
commensurate with the cost. The Imhoff tank was quite
as efficient in sludge digestion as experimental septic tanks
have been and much more efficient so far as sedimentation
of the sewage is concerned. It was operated without the
production of the offensive odors characteristic of the septic
tank and the sludge itself was disposed of without creating
a nuisance. The effluent from the Imhoff tank was normally
as fresh in appearance and odor as the sewage flowing into
the tank.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The experience of the New Jersey State Board of Health
with Imhoff tanks has been that if properly designed,
constructed and operated, they are a valuable means of
sewage clarification. The observation of its engineers has
shown that under these conditions the tanks overcome a
great deal of trouble due to odors and greatly simplify
the sludge problem. “However, their proper operation is a
considerable problem,” reads one of its reports. “And
the cost of keeping them in working order is several times
greater than for septic or sedimentation tanks.” In view
of the initial cost of this form of tank as compared with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>the older single story types the New Jersey engineers believe
that “in cases where the works are far removed from
a populous community, so that the odor problem is not
serious, it is doubtful whether the Imhoff tank has any
material advantage over a properly constructed, well baffled
sedimentation tank of the old type.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Cleveland Sewage Testing Station reports that the
most consistent results were obtained from the operation of
the Imhoff tank, an average suspended matter removal of
50 per cent. being secured. A recent city report says:
“In general it may be said that a detention period of thirty
minutes accomplished a removal of suspended matter from
40 to 45 per cent. as compared with a 50 per cent. removal
effected by a detention period of two hours and fifteen
minutes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In a bulletin of the California Board of Health, Charles
G. Hyde sums up the importance of the septic process thus:
“The septic process as carried out either in the Cameron or
Imhoff type, but especially in the latter, has at present two
distinct fields of usefulness; first, it constitutes an effective
means of preparation for any final process which can be
better conducted with a sewage from which the suspended
solids are more or less completely removed; secondly, it may
be employed when disposal by dilution is permissible if the
source of unsightly sludge and scum is removed.” Another
advantage may be added, the Imhoff tank produces a sludge
that can be disposed of easily.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Chemical Precipitation</h3>

<p class='c017'>By using some coagulant such as copperas, lime, sulphate
of alumina or perchloride of iron, the subsidence in
basins of between 40 and 55 per cent. of the total organic
matter and between 60 and 95 per cent. of the total suspended
matter can be obtained. The bacterial removal is
between 80 and 90 per cent., depending upon the character
of the sewage. The objections to this process are great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>cost of chemicals and labor required and the difficulty of
disposing of a large amount of sludge. There are a few
plants of this kind in operation at the present time and
there seems to be a general agreement among authorities
that the process is now a back number. Fowler says, “It
may be doubted whether dilute sewages resulting from the
lavish use of water in American cities lend themselves generally
to economical treatment by this process.” Metcalf
and Eddy in their “American Sewerage Practice” express
the opinion that the quantity of chemicals required for results
would be a prohibitive expense. The sewerage commission
report of New Jersey contains the statement that
“on the standpoint of the officials in charge of the experimental
station at Lawrence, Massachusetts, chemical precipitation
is a process of the past.” The experiments of
the Massachusetts State Board of Health showed that it
is quite impossible to obtain effluents by chemical precipitation
which compare in organic purity with those obtained
by intermittent sand filtration. About the only plants of
any importance in the United States are those at Worcester,
Massachusetts, and Providence, Rhode Island. According
to the report of the Superintendent of Sewers of Worcester,
the experimental plant in that city has shown that “the
cost of operation of Imhoff tanks and sprinkling filters per
million gallons of sewage treated would be much less than
the cost of operation of chemical precipitation or sand
filtration as carried on in Worcester.”</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Slate Beds</h3>

<p class='c017'>The equipment for this process consists of tanks with
horizontal slabs of slate separated a few inches by stone
blocks. The sewage is allowed to stand in the tank for
about two hours, during which the suspended matter is deposited
on the slabs and is digested by multifarious forms
known as aerobic germs, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i>, germs requiring oxygen for
the continuance of their proper vital function. The deposits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>are thereby reduced to harmless and inoffensive
humus. Slate beds are dosed and rested alternately so as
to give them an opportunity to replenish their supply of
oxygen. Multiple units are therefore necessary. The effluent
must be treated as a tank effluent. Fowler suggests
that when filters are used to purify the effluent, “humus”
tanks be provided between the slate and the filter to retain
the solids washed away from the beds and somewhat to
equalize the composition of the effluent passing into the
filter.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Dosing Chambers</h3>

<p class='c017'>After the effluent has passed from a tank after being
treated by one or more of the preliminary processes, it
usually flows into a compartment known as the dosing chamber
where it is admitted to the filter for further purification.</p>

<p class='c000'>When enough of the liquid has accumulated in the chamber
it is automatically emptied by means of a siphon, thus
permitting the intermittent application of the sewage to the
filter bed. When more than one bed is used the siphons are
arranged so that the liquid alternately flows to different
filters or parts of filters.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Contact Filters—Single and Double</h3>

<p class='c017'>The treatment of sewage in a single contact filter is
classed as a preliminary process and when treated in double
contact beds or those arranged in tandem as a final process.
A contact filter is a basin filled with broken stone, coke, slag
or coarse gravel, thoroughly underdrained. The size of
stone or other material to be used depends upon the degree
of purification desired, and the manner of operating the
beds. The smaller the stone the more brilliant the effluent
will be, but all reports agree that the cost of operation will
be greater and that there will be a more rapid loss of filter
capacity. Experience has taught the superiority of the
coarser material because the interstices being so large the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>bed is not so liable to choke. Watson advises a fine medium
bed only when a highly purified effluent is desired, when
it would be difficult to get rid of humus from the filtrate,
when a high cost of maintenance is not prohibitive and when
a temporary stoppage of the whole plant would not be a
serious matter. He believes it is not suitable for installations
of any magnitude. Beds have been built with various
depths, the range being between four and seven feet. Some
have been built shallower and have given good results. The
method of applying the sewage is important. Some tanks
are overfed and others are underfed. Francis E. Daniels,
Director of Water and Sewage Inspection of the New Jersey
State Board of Health, describes a method which has
been found to be successful in plants in this state. At these
plants the effluent is applied on the top and at one corner of
the contact beds. At the point of application a small area
of contact material from 6 inches to one foot deep is removed
from the top of the bed, and fine cinders are substituted.
An embankment about a foot high is constructed
of the same material around this area so that all of the
tank effluent applied to the beds strains through the cinders.
Mr. Daniels says that a great deal of the suspended matter
is thus removed from the tank effluent which reduces clogging
and increases the life of the beds. It is Mr. Daniels’
experience that the value of underfed beds is diminishing.
If the effluent is very septic this method has the advantage
of reducing odors, but as Mr. Daniels has pointed out, the
practise of reducing the storage capacity of tanks is becoming
prevalent.</p>

<p class='c000'>In many plants the sewage is distributed by mechanical
appliances, some being motor driven and others cable
driven. Springfield, Missouri, which uses a motor drive,
reports a saving in power, first cost, moving weight, and
maintenance, over the cable drive. Another advantage is
that the length of the filter can be increased at will. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>total cost of the distribution per million gallons according
to Springfield’s experience is $1.25 for cable drive and
$1.61 for direct motor drive.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the sewage has been distributed on the beds so
that the interstices are filled, it is allowed to stand for a
time. The bed is then drained and rested. While standing
the sewage comes in contact with a jelly-like film which
forms on the surface of the stone, and important changes
occur. As with the septic tanks contact beds require a certain
period in which to ripen. The time of contact and the
period of rest vary in different plants. The rate of filtration
varies according to the construction of the beds, the range
is between 600,000 and 1,200,000 gallons per acre per day.
The effluent from single contact beds is not stable but that
from double contact beds is non-putrescible and low in suspended
matter, although somewhat turbid. It can be discharged
without offense into small streams. Single contact
beds have seldom been used for final treatment of sewage
and fewer filters of this kind are now being constructed even
in conjunction with any preparatory treatment. The general
opinion is that this process is on the wane. Watson
says, “It may now be assumed that percolating filters are
being constructed in England in preference to contact beds
wherever the conditions are suitable.” In America they
are not being adopted for large installation but they are
still considered for small disposal works. In their fifth report
the Royal Sewage Commission of England states that
taking into account the gradual loss of capacity of contact
beds, a cubic yard of material arranged in the form of a
percolating filter will generally treat satisfactorily nearly
twice as much tank liquor as a cubic yard of material in a
contact bed. Comparing the efficiency of contact beds and
percolating filters it is claimed that the latter are better
adapted to variations of flow and that the effluent is usually
much better aerated; and apart from the suspended solids
are of a more uniform character. With percolating filters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>the likelihood of odors is greater than from contact beds and
there may be a greater nuisance from flies.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the report of the City of Leeds, England, the results
of very valuable experiments are given. It says, “Double
contact beds give good results with crude sewage and excellent
results with partially settled sewage or with septic
effluent. Single contact beds are insufficient for dealing
with crude sewage but give fair results with settled sewage
or with septic effluent. The real difficulty with contact beds
is to maintain capacity.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The principal advantages of this process according to
reports are low operating head, and less nuisance from
odor and flies, and the disadvantages are large areas required
and cost of maintenance.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Trickling, Percolating or Sprinkling Filters</h3>

<p class='c017'>Trickling or percolating filters consist of beds of coarse
grained material such as pebbles or crushed stone, one-eighth
to four inches in size, from four feet to ten feet deep
and well underdrained. The character and strength of the
sewage should determine the size of the material, the depth
of the bed and the rate of operation. Some engineers give
the capacity as about 20,000 persons per acre of stone surface;
others say the rate of flow should be from one to two
and one-half million gallons per acre. In some designs an
auxiliary air supply is inducted into the filter material by
tubes connected with the underground system. The Atlanta
plant is equipped with ventilator hoods having weather
vanes so that the mouth of each hood always points toward
the wind. “This form of ventilation is of no particular
value and may be detrimental in cold weather,” says Glenn
D. Holmes, Chief Engineer of the Syracuse, N. Y., Sewer
Board. By means of spray jets and moving sprinklers operated
with some device for varying the pressure, such as a
butterfly valve, or by means of an intermittent dosing tank
operated by a siphon, the sewage is sprinkled or deposited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>on the surface of the bed in thin films and drops; thus the
sewage is freed of objectionable gases and takes up oxygen
as it passes through the air and through the filter. Sprinkling
filters do not produce the best results when crude sewage
is applied. They are most efficient when the suspended
matter has been removed by some preparatory treatment.
In some cities the screening process is first used, in others
the sewage receives a preliminary treatment in tanks. Well
designed and efficiently operated filters of this kind produce
an effluent that is stable but not clear. Some plants
are equipped with secondary settling tanks through which
the effluent flows before final discharge and is freed of
the humus-like particles it contains after leaving the filter.
Reports agree that the effluent is not nearly so good in appearance
and has a much higher percentage of bacteria than
that produced by good intermittent sand filters. As compared
with the double contact process the general opinion
is that sprinkling filters are superior in respect to the removal
of organic matter and cost less to operate. The
chief advantages of a sprinkling filter are the high rate of
filtration and the low cost of operation. The disadvantages
are a possible nuisance, especially during hot weather, from
odor when anything but fresh tank sewage is sprayed; and
the development of insect life. Fowler says, “However
economical their construction and maintenance it cannot
be said that such a process meets all sanitary and æsthetic
requirements.” The experience of Worcester, Massachusetts,
at its experimental station was that more than twenty
times as much sewage per unit of area was treated by the
sprinkler filter as could be treated by intermittent sand
filtration, and more than ten times as much per cubic yard
of filter. Four times as much sewage was treated by these
experimental filters as could be treated satisfactorily by
experimental contact beds. In order to obtain equal nitrification
with contact beds at least three contacts would be
required.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>
  <h3 class='c008'>Intermittent Sand Filters</h3>
</div>

<p class='c017'>As a final process of purification in sections where land
and filter material are available at small cost the intermittent
sand filter is superior to any other. This fact has been
established by experience and experiments. The filter material
may be clean, coarse sand or any other porous soil.
If a natural area is available the method of construction is
very much simplified and economical. The top soil is removed
and used in embankments between the beds. If the
water tables are low the beds are not underdrained. In
artificial beds the size of the sand is important. While fine
sand will give a more brilliant effluent than a coarser material,
the sewage has to be applied in small doses with long
periods of rest. The rate of purification is higher in coarse
sand filters and the effluent while containing more bacteria
is non-putrescible. About twenty-four inches of sand
should cover the underdrains of tile, placed about five feet
apart, and surrounded by small-sized gravel.</p>

<p class='c000'>In some beds the entire bottom above the underdrain is
covered with about six inches of gravel. In others the bottom
is ridged, the underdrains being placed at the bottom of
the valleys which are then partially or wholly filled with
gravel. Risers are constructed at the head of the underdrain
and an intercepting drain completes the system. The
beds vary in size and number according to the amount of
sewage to be treated. The operation of the filter is very
important. The sewage must be applied rapidly in rotation
to each bed until the surface is covered with about three
inches of the liquid. The bed is then slowly drained and
allowed to rest. Overdosing and lack of aeration cause
clogging. The surface must at all times be kept clean and
loose. To maintain this condition it is sometimes necessary
to break up the surface to a small depth or periodically to
remove the deposit on the surface.</p>

<p class='c000'>In cold climates the operation of the filters in winter is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>difficult and the quality of the effluent somewhat impaired.
Several methods have been adopted to prevent freezing.
Some filter beds are ridged so that when dosed the sewage
flows in gutters. The ice which forms at the top of the
sewage remains suspended on the ridges, thus permitting
succeeding doses to flow underneath the ice. In other plants
the surface of the filter is scraped into small piles which
form a support for the ice. It is claimed that by this method
the cost of subsequent cleaning is less than when the beds
are ridged.</p>

<p class='c000'>The effluent in properly constructed and managed plants
is clear and odorless. The bacterial purification is as high
as ninety-nine per cent. The Massachusetts State Board of
Health in one of its reports says, “When sewage filters
slowly and intermittently through five feet of porous earth
and sand, an effluent is obtained which is as free from organic
matter, from ammonia and from nitrites as many a
natural spring water.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The only drawback noted to this process is the cost of
treatment in large quantities where land and filter material
are not available. Francis E. Daniels says that under
such conditions the cost is almost prohibitive. For many
cities sufficient area cannot be obtained at any price, and
as population increases the difficulty will become greater.</p>

<p class='c000'>The New York State Board of Health in general will
approve only of the following rates of operation for different
types of filters where suitable provision for preliminary
treatment is made: Intermittent sand filters, 100,000 gallons
per acre per day; contact beds, 100,000 gallons per
acre per day per foot of depth; sprinkling filters, 300,000
gallons per acre per day per foot of depth. These rates
of operation are based on a sewage contribution of 100 gallons
per capita daily and no variation from these rates of
filtration is allowed for any other per capita contribution
of sewage. The allowable effective depths of said filters will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>in general range from three to five feet; contact beds from
four to seven feet; sprinkling filters, from five to nine feet.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Broad Irrigation</h3>

<p class='c017'>Broad irrigation, or sewage farming, is the oldest process
of sewage purification, but the constant increase in
population has made it necessary for cities to adopt other
methods because of the area of land necessary for such a
plant. Two processes are used, surface irrigation and filtration,
a greater area of land being required for the former.
Sometimes the two are combined into one process. For filtration
and irrigation the sewage is generally first subjected
to sedimentation or screening and then flows on carefully
prepared land on which crops are usually grown. The areas
are underdrained and are equipped with distribution systems.</p>

<p class='c000'>Local conditions determine the method of irrigation, the
ridge and furrow system being most generally used. The
efficiency of the process depends upon the quality of the soil
and proper management. Among the factors which should
enter into the selection of the site are the quality of the
soil, composition of sewage, method of disposal, kind of
crops to be planted, contours and slope of surface, nature
of the sub-soil, sub-soil waters, transportation facilities,
nature of streams, nature of adjacent property, and availability
of water supply. The best lands consist of a fine
layer of alluvium overlaying a sub-soil of gravel, chalk or
other porous material. Various kinds of crops are grown
on sewage farms and the revenues therefrom help to reduce
the cost of operation. They also assist in the purification.
The principal drawback are heavy transportation cost and
a prejudice against sewage-grown produce. During the
rainy season when the quantity of sewage requiring treatment
is greatest, less sewage can be used for irrigation and
the growing of crops of sewage farms. All evidence points
to the fact that broad irrigation is on a steady decline, although
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>the efficiency of the treatment under favorable conditions
is very high.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Disinfection</h3>

<p class='c017'>When the bacterial efficiency of an effluent from either
preparatory or final treatment is low and the effluent is
discharged into a body of water from which water supplies
are derived or shell fish are taken, disinfection is often found
necessary. The purpose is to destroy objectionable bacteria
and disease germs. Hypo-chlorite of lime and liquid chlorine
are the two chemicals most commonly used. The principal
advantages of the liquid chlorine over the hypo-chlorite
according to plant supervisors and operators, are less
cost of operation and space required for both apparatus
and storage of materials, no loss of strength, no lime sludge,
and no mixing tanks required. The claim is also made
that it can be better controlled. Chlorine, however, is more
expensive than hypo-chlorite and the control apparatus
usually costs more. There is general agreement among engineers,
that except as an emergency measure or under the
above stated conditions, disinfection is too expensive a
process on account of the amount of chemical required.
This varies with the amount, method and degree of previous
treatment of the sewage and the degree of bacterial elimination
desired. Tests at the Cleveland Testing Station indicated
that from five to seven parts per million of available
chlorine will effect a bacterial removal of from eighty-five
to ninety per cent.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Activated Sludge Process</h3>

<p class='c017'>Sewage treatment by aeration in the presence of sludge
is the latest development in sewage disposal, and the process
is attracting a great deal of attention in America. Milwaukee
has constructed a plant to treat two million gallons of
sewage a day. Houston, Texas, is operating a plant to treat
the sewage for 160,000 persons, and Escanaba, Michigan,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>and Jersey City, N. J., have favored the process. Experiments
are now being conducted in Milwaukee, Baltimore,
Washington, Cleveland, Regina, Chicago, Lawrence, Mass.,
Brooklyn, New Haven, Conn., the University of Illinois and
many other places. The efficiency and economy of the process
as compared with others which have long been in use have
not been completely established. The chief points in dispute
are sludge disposal and cost, but the indications are
that these questions will soon be satisfactorily answered.</p>

<p class='c000'>The process consists of passing raw sewage through
tanks from eight to twenty feet deep in which a certain
amount of activated sludge is always present. To mix the
sewage and the activated sludge air is forced into the bottom
of the tank under low pressure of sufficient volume to keep
the liquor violently disturbed. From this aerating tank
the mixture passes to another or sedimentation tank where
the sludge settles and from which the clear effluent passes
over a weir to its final destination. In order to maintain
the proper volume of activated sludge in the aerating tank
a portion of the sludge is pumped back from the sedimentation
tank. The balance of the sludge is pressed and used for
fertilizer base. The Milwaukee experiments indicate that
in order to produce a clear, non-putrescible effluent about
four hours aeration is required, twenty per cent. of activated
sludge maintained in the aerating tank, and about
1.75 cubic feet of free air supplied per gallon of sewage
treated.</p>

<p class='c000'>The effluent is clear, odorless and practically free from
suspended matter. The sludge will begin to decompose
after forty-eight hours and must be pressed and dried
within that time. Chief Engineer, T. Chalkley Hatton, of
the Milwaukee Sewerage Commission, estimates that the
sludge can be reduced to a fertilizer basis for about $8.75
per dry ton, including overhead charges. Basing the value
of the sludge produced upon a low price per unit, he finds
that Milwaukee sludge is worth $12.50 per dry ton, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>represents a clear profit of $3.75 a ton. From ten to twelve
million gallons can be treated upon one acre of ground,
which is about one-fifth the area required for sedimentation
tanks and sprinkling filters. The reasons for the adoption
of this process by Milwaukee after experimentation by
competent engineers for more than a year are given by Mr.
Hatton in a recent address before New York State city officials
as follows: “It produces a better effluent than any
other known process of sewage treatment except land treatment
or intermittent sand filtration; it can be built upon a
comparatively small area; it produces no objectionable
odors or flies; it produces a sludge of sufficient value to
meet the cost of its reduction to a fertilizer and therefore
relieves the city of the difficult, complicated and wasteful
method of sludge disposal common to all other processes;
it is subject to complete and satisfactory control throughout
its operation; it is not materially influenced by climatic
conditions; occupying a small area, its first cost is less than
any other known process from which an equal character of
effluent can be obtained; its operating cost is not prohibitive.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In a discussion before the Iowa Section of the American
Waterworks Association Dr. Edward Bartow commended
activated sludge for its value as a fertilizer. This has been
proved, he said, by its chemical composition, by its reaction
with various solids and by its effect on the growth of plants.
Pot cultures and garden experiments have shown that the
nitrogen is in a very available form.</p>

<p class='c000'>E. E. Sands, City Engineer of Houston, Texas, bases
this statement on results of experiments conducted for a
year: “Our investigation has demonstrated that sewage
can be disposed of anywhere that there is a vacant tract of
land in the city without creating a nuisance and without
any objectionable feature.” The total estimated cost for
treatment will be about $9.14 per million gallons when the
plant is run at the rate of 18,900,000 gallons per day. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>estimates that the total cost for treatment by the Imhoff
tanks and the sprinkling filters would be not less than $11
per million gallons.</p>

<p class='c000'>After an extended investigation by their sanitary engineers,
Armour &amp; Company have concluded that the activated
sludge method will satisfactorily purify the industrial
wastes from their Packingtown factories. Assistant
Superintendent, M. D. Harding, estimates that from data
now available the cost per million gallons exclusive of depreciation,
interest and repairs, will be $3.</p>

<p class='c000'>When considering the applicability of this process to
conditions in any city consideration should be given to
the following points. The process requires competent supervision,
which Mr. Hatton claims may be a blessing in disguise
in view of the experiences of cities which, after having
built disposal plants of various kinds, have left their operation
to the kind mercies of Providence with disastrous
results. This process also requires the expenditure for
constant power. The cheaper the power the more adaptable
the process is commercially; but if the unit is small and
the power cost high, the operating cost may be too great.
The sludge must be constantly treated to avoid nuisance.
The process produces a high degree of purification. If the
local conditions do not demand this the process might be
too expensive in comparison with some other process which
will produce a satisfactory effluent.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Other Processes</h3>

<p class='c017'>A few cities, including Oklahoma City and Santa Monica,
Cal., have electrolysis treatment plants. The process
consists in passing the sewage between a system of electrodes.
The change is brought about by chemical reaction
from newly formed chemical reagents produced by the decomposition
of inorganic compounds already in solution.
It is still regarded as an unestablished process.</p>

<p class='c000'>Boston has within the last year been testing a new process
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>of sewage purification invented and patented by a Boston
chemist. By the addition of an acid, an attempt is
made to precipitate the bulk of suspended matter and to
form a sludge which can be dried and degreased thereby
producing a salable and greaseless fertilizer as well as recovering
valuable grease. Experiments by E. S. Dorr gave
results so full of promise that arrangements were made for
a study of the process under the supervision of the Sanitary
Research Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology. Robert Spurr Weston gives the results of
this study in a recent issue of the <cite>American Journal of
Public Health</cite>. His conclusions are that “with facts at
hand the process would be very satisfactory for Boston
from a sanitary standpoint, and is more promising economically
than any other known method.” He includes in
his comparison the activated sludge process. An experiment
by Boston on a larger scale has been recommended.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Trade Wastes</h3>

<p class='c017'>Industrial trade wastes, such as those coming from canneries,
breweries, woolen mills, laundries, dye and cleaning
works, paper mills, iron foundries, gas works and packing
establishments and others cause nuisances around disposal
plants, and the problem of their proper disposal is more
difficult of satisfactory solution than the treatment of domestic
sewage. Some wastes can be treated with domestic
sewage at the disposal works without any difficulty, others
require special treatment before being allowed to enter the
sewers and often it is desirable to keep certain wastes out
of the main sewers and dispose of them independently.
Each particular problem must be considered by itself with
due regard both to conditions at the factory, the expense
burden on the producer of the waste and to the body of water
into which the effluent is to be discharged. There are instances
where cities have reimbursed certain manufacturers
for treating their wastes separately, and others where the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>manufacturers have reimbursed the city for the additional
treatment required.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Sludge Disposal and Value</h3>

<p class='c017'>Authorities are generally agreed that the sludge problem
is the center of the entire sewage problem, because it causes
more trouble and is the most expensive part of the treatment.
The method of handling it is just as important as
the treatment of the sewage.</p>

<p class='c000'>Wet sludge can be pumped out on land or into shallow
places or it can be sent to sea in ships and allowed to sink.
If pumped on land it must be spread out in very thin layers.
If discharged into trenches it is ploughed into the ground
after it has dried. In either case a large area of land is
necessary and odors cannot be eliminated. Only cities located
on or near the seashore can send their sludge to sea,
and then the cost of disposal is rather high.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sludge can be dried by pressing, in centrifugal drying
machines, by mixing with some dry matter or by discharging
upon drying beds. The cost of pressing is high, depending
upon the amount of lime added, the kind of sludge
pressed, and the size of the works. George S. Webster
states that the average cost in large cities is ten cents per
ton of wet sludge. It is especially applicable to chemical
precipitation works as it must first be treated with lime
or coal powder. When dried in machines the liquid contains
much organic matter and is objectionable. The simplest
method is to discharge the sludge upon drying beds of
porous material and underdrained. The time for drying
depends upon sewage treatment. Imhoff tank sludge will
dry in less than a week, septic tank sludge in two weeks
or more, and sludge from plain sedimentation will require
about two months in summer and almost five months in
winter. Cleveland, in order to overcome weather conditions
at its experimental plant, built a covered sludge bed, modeled
after standard greenhouse construction. The report
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>from the Testing Station is that during summer the period
of drying is approximately the same as or possibly a little
longer than with open beds. Eliminating the three winter
months, the station report says, it is possible to operate
beds of this type so that one square foot of surface will
dry 0.8 cubic feet of sludge per year. Francis E. Daniels
suggests that sludge can be handled faster by drying a small
portion at one time and removing it from the bed before
the next portion is drained off.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dry sludge can be used for fertilizer or for filling low
lands or it can be incinerated. Its fertilizing value is disputed
except when produced by the activated sludge method.
The filling in method is economical. Authorities advise the
consideration of incineration by cities which burn their
garbage.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Imhoff’s recommendations are the use of sludge for
agricultural purposes and for filling in low land. “In both
cases,” he says, “the sludge must first be dried and this is
best effected upon a drying bed after the sludge has been
decomposed in an inoffensive, odorless manner, in a separate
tank through which sewage does not flow.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Many unsuccessful efforts have been made to extract the
valuable ingredients from sewage, but to date the experience
has been that they have been more costly to recover
than they are worth. Dr. McLean Wilson, Sanitary Inspector
of the West Riding of Yorkshire Rivers Board, believes
that the valuable ingredients of sewage will ultimately
be recovered and used since many capable experimenters
are at work on the problem. H. W. Clark, Chemist of the
Massachusetts State Board of Health, is of the opinion that
sludge has some value and that “it seems inevitable that
as the processes of drying, pressing and fat separation are
improved and as nitrogen advances in price sewage sludge
will become of greater agricultural value than at present.”
Experiments have been made at the Philadelphia Sewage
Testing Station by burning dry sludge and wet sludge mixed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>with fine coal. The results were unsuccessful. Experiments
have also been made at the Cleveland station where it
was found that the sewage sludge contained about one-half
as much nitrogen and one-third as much phosphates as does
the garbage tankage.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Management and Supervision</h3>

<p class='c017'>No matter how well a sewage disposal plant is designed
or constructed it will not do its work in a satisfactory manner
and produce desired results unless it is efficiently managed.
Every plant should be in charge of a man who has
knowledge of sewage disposal principles, is thoroughly
familiar with his plant and who can act intelligently in an
emergency. The New Jersey State Sewerage Commission
in one of its reports notes the tendency of local authorities
to permit the deterioration of disposal plants usually
through inattention. “It cannot be too strongly urged on
those charged with these, as of other public works, that a
competent man in charge is a primary necessity and that
the plant should be kept continuously in the highest state of
efficiency.” The same condition is complained of by the
California State Board of Health and other state organizations.
In one of its bulletins the California State Board
says that “some of the plants are operating very indifferently
well and some very badly. The general situation
shows plainly the need of expert advice to municipalities
with respect to general methods and necessary efficiencies
from some central authority.”</p>

<p class='c000'>D. C. Faber, Industrial Engineer of the Iowa State College,
goes so far as to claim that practically all nuisances in
connection with plants can be traced directly to failure to
give them attention. He says that even where plants have
been found too small increased care in many cases could be
made to offset lack of capacity.</p>

<p class='c000'>In several states, such as New York, Pennsylvania,
New Jersey, Kansas, Ohio and Massachusetts, the State
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Boards of Health have supervision over the designing of
new plants and the operation of those established. The
good results obtained as a result of this supervision are
evidence that similar powers should be granted to all state
boards of health.</p>

<p class='c000'>With a plant designed to meet local conditions, properly
constructed and efficiently managed, a city should have no
difficulty in disposing of its sewage economically, in a sanitary
manner and without creating a nuisance.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>So many cities either collect ashes and rubbish together or
the two are collected by the same department or under the
same contract that any attempt to give the experience of
American municipalities with the collection of each of these
wastes would be of little value. The collection of both kinds
of waste will, therefore, be discussed with the idea of presenting
such information as will give any city, large or
small, a basis for determining the feasibility of ash and
rubbish collection by municipal employees or by contract,
giving the various methods used in the larger American communities,
so that the one best adapted to local conditions may
be adopted, and the price a city should pay for the service.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Collection Systems</h3>

<p class='c017'>The systems of collection and disposal are so closely related
that they must be considered together. There are two
kinds of collection systems, the combined and the separate.
The combined system may be further divided.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many large cities collect garbage, rubbish and ashes separately.
Garbage is then incinerated or disposed of by the
reduction method. Ashes are used for fill and the rubbish
is sorted either at the dumps or in utilization plants and the
unsalable material either dumped or incinerated or both.</p>

<p class='c000'>The separate system is profitable only in the larger cities
where reduction plants can be operated at or near a profit,
where an incineration plant can be centrally located in order
to reduce the cost of haul or the heat can be used to produce
power or where the reclaimable rubbish is sufficient to
pay for rescuing it.</p>

<p class='c000'>A system that can be used with nearly all methods of
disposal is the separate collection of garbage and the combined
collection of rubbish and ashes. This is the most
popular system in America, for in many cities garbage is
disposed of separately and rubbish is dumped. In many
such cases, and especially where the ashes are used for fill,
separation is required to allow the disposal of the ashes
in places not suitable for mixed material.</p>

<p class='c000'>In cities which have destructors for the incineration of
garbage and rubbish and which use the ashes for fill, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>separate collection of ashes and the combined collection of
garbage and rubbish is the best system. In some cases a
part of the ashes is added to the garbage to aid combustion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Where the combined collection of garbage, rubbish and
ashes is used the city disposes of all these wastes either by
dumping or by total incineration.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a few places furnace ashes are collected separately
and rubbish, garbage and stove ashes together. When this
system is used the furnace ashes are used for fill and the
other wastes are incinerated.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is considerable difference of opinion as to which
plan is desirable, but practically all agree that local conditions
should contribute the chief factor in determining
which system is the best for a city.</p>

<p class='c000'>The method of disposal is another factor. Reports
agree that if all wastes are collected together as a rule the
cost of collection will be less than if each is collected separately.</p>

<p class='c000'>John H. Gregory, sanitary expert, says that separate
collection will be found in many instances to be less convenient
at the house and more complicated and more expensive
than the combined collection. He asserts that the
combined collection will usually prove to be cleaner and
to have fewer objectionable features, and with this system
it should be easier to secure and to keep a better grade of
employees. He points out that the mixing of garbage with
rubbish and ashes will prevent in a large measure the blowing
about of the latter, will lessen the dust nuisance, and
indirectly may lessen the cost of street cleaning. The decomposition
of garbage is far less noticeable and from the
point of view of preventing a nuisance the receptacles and
wagons will not require such frequent cleaning. He says,
also, that the fly nuisance is reduced to a minimum and that
there is less likelihood of odor should the refuse be stored
up for final disposition. As but one type of wagon is required
for collection Mr. Gregory believes that the system
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>is probably easier to adopt and easier to enforce, fewer
regulations being required.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a discussion of the advantages of the incineration
method of disposal the <cite>American Journal of Public Health</cite>
says that ashes may be used for incineration on account of
the percentage of unburned coal which they usually contain.
The percentage of unburned coal in ashes is between
19½ and 24½. Several experts call attention to the cost
of incineration. Mr. Gregory believes that when refuse is
incinerated it may be more expensive to burn all ashes
with garbage and rubbish than simply to burn the garbage
and rubbish. He points out that in some cities it may be
found advantageous to adopt the combined system in certain
districts and separate collections in others, depending
upon local conditions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Careful consideration should be given to the following
reasons for and against keeping ashes and garbage separate:
It is not necessary to collect ashes so frequently as
it is garbage; different methods of disposal require separate
handling; garbage with its moisture when mixed with
ashes will not freeze in the can as readily in winter, thus
facilitating collection. Some experts, however, assert it is
more desirable to keep the wastes separate in order to use
the ashes for fill and to sell the reclaimable rubbish. Many
cities require the separation either of all wastes or of
garbage. Of the fifty largest cities in the United States
and all cities in New York State only thirteen do not require
that each class of refuse be kept separate. One or two
report that the plan had to be abandoned as it was found
difficult to get the people, especially those living in the
poorer districts, to comply with the rule of keeping the
wastes separate. Other cities, which do require a separation,
report that while it was found difficult at the beginning
to enforce the regulation, persistent educational work
and patience eventually brought their reward. Where all
of the waste is dumped many cities prohibit the mixing of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>paper or combustibles with ashes and rubbish. If this is
not done the experience of many cities is that there are
liable to be serious dump fires.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Methods of Collection</h3>

<p class='c017'>Some cities have ash and rubbish collection done by contract;
in others the work is done by city employees; in a few
both plans are used; and in many small communities the
work is done by licensed collectors. The last Census Report
shows that in eighty-five of the 158 cities for which
statistics are given the collection is made either by contract
or by the city, 72 per cent. being collected by the cities and
28 per cent. by contract.</p>

<p class='c000'>Collection by private collectors is by no means confined
to the small cities, as the following table indicates:</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f36'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r36'>36</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>City also collects.</p>
</div>

<p class='c000'>John H. Gregory is of the opinion that, as a general rule,
the best results may be expected from municipal ownership
and operation of collection equipment. The Chicago City
Waste Commission reports that where the householder hires
a private scavenger to remove ashes and rubbish it usually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>results in greater cost than when the work is systematically
done by the city at public expense. If work is done by
contract supervision at public expense is almost imperative
when the best results are desired. Regulation must be
strict and well enforced. The experiences of cities which
have used all three methods are in favor of municipal collection.</p>

<p class='c000'>The stringent contract regulating the collection of garbage
and ashes by contract in West Orange, New Jersey,
contains some suggestions. That part referring to the collection
of ashes provides that the contractor must have
an office in town with a telephone and a person in attendance
from 9 a.m. until 4 p.m. If notified of the failure of any
employee to remove ashes the same must be removed within
two hours. Ashes must be kept separate from garbage and
collected in a different vehicle. Ashes must be placed in
covered wagons and “properly constructed so as to conceal
the contents and to prevent scattering on public streets
and highways. Rubbish, papers, tin cans, etc., shall be
considered ashes.” It further requires that wagons must
not be overloaded, must be numbered and painted once a
year and cleaned each day. The contractor must discharge
employees guilty of neglect or insolence. The dumping
ground must be kept clean, and papers, tin cans, etc., must
be covered with three inches of dirt. “If the work is unsatisfactory
the Council may by resolution terminate the contract
and the surety company will be compelled to make
good the damages the city shall suffer as a result of the
breach of contract.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In some cities where the refuse is disposed of by incineration,
the municipality does the collecting and delivers to
a privately owned disposal plant.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Districting the City</h3>

<p class='c017'>The number and location of the districts into which a
city is divided depends upon the size, topography and population
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>of the municipality. The layout should also be influenced
somewhat by the kind of collection equipment used.
Particular attention should be given to the various kinds of
collection vehicles and especially to the desirability of employing
motor or horse-drawn vehicles or a combination of
both, before the city is districted. The location of the
dumps or incinerators and the frequency of collection are
also important factors. It is generally agreed that the
division should be such as to shorten the length of haul as
much as possible and to avoid steep grades with loaded
wagons.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Organization of Collection Force</h3>

<p class='c017'>The organization of the force depends upon the kind
of equipment, system of collection, districting of city, location
of receptacles, frequency of removal and time of collection.
The common system abroad where the can is placed
at the curb, is to have one or two workmen accompany the
wagon, one acting as driver, while the other empties the
cans. Some authorities say this is the most economical way.
The common method of operating in this country is to have
the driver make the collection from the back yard. This is
claimed by many to be uneconomical, as the whole collection
work is retarded. In some cities the so-called gang
system is used. Workmen go down each side of the street
about one hour ahead of the wagon and roll the cans to
the curb. The driver empties the cans and workmen following
the wagon take the empty cans to the back yard.
Many believe that this makes the best use of the more expensive
part of the equipment. John H. Gregory points
out that when possible one man should always have the
same route in order that he may become acquainted with
the district and households.</p>

<p class='c000'>The organization of the collecting force must be elastic
so that changes may be easily and quickly made on account
of the seasons and weather conditions. More wagons and
more men are employed in winter than in summer. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>also found necessary to increase the collection force when
traffic conditions are made difficult by a snow storm and
other causes.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Type of Equipment</h3>

<p class='c017'>The essential features to be considered in connection
with the design and installation of equipment are sanitation,
freedom from nuisance and selection of proper apparatus
for economical operation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Very definite conclusions have been reached by experts
and officials about the kind of ash can to be used. It is
agreed that the size must be limited because of the difficulty
of lifting heavy receptacles into the collecting wagon.
Workman’s compensation insurance for city employees has
forced cities to give more attention to this part of the equipment
than previously for the reason that many employees
are injured by straining. It is also agreed that the receptacles
must be of metal or lined with metal to prevent fire from
hot ashes. All receptacles, if left at the curb, should be
covered to prevent dust.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some cities require householders to use regulation size
cans. It is asserted that this plan facilitates the collection.
The attached tables contain a description of the type and
size of can used.</p>

<p class='c000'>There has been much discussion about the best type of
wagon for ash collection, and much experimenting has been
done and is still commanding attention. It is agreed that
special attention must be given to ease in loading and emptying,
to provision against leakage, dust and unsightly
appearance, to noise when loading and in motion, to durability
and to cost of maintenance. As a considerable portion
of the men employed in collecting suffer strains and
rupture caused by lifting heavy cans, it is imperative that
the wagon be as low as possible. Most of those now in use
are five feet or more from the sidewalk to the top of the
sides. If the bodies of these wagons hung low, as they do
in some cities, and the capacity were made up in length,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>there would be less strain on the men and time would be
saved in dumping.</p>

<p class='c000'>The capacity of the wagon is influenced by the length of
haul and topography of the city. In its study of the collection
and disposal of waste in Ohio cities the Ohio State
Board of Health says it is the consensus of opinion that for
best economic results the wagon capacity should be from
three to four cubic yards for the combined collection of
ashes and rubbish. The average weight of rubbish and
ashes is from 800 to 1100 pounds per cubic yard, according
to some reports. H. DeB. Parsons, a sanitary expert, says
the average weight of ashes per cubic yard is 1350 pounds
and rubbish 200 pounds. Generally the mixture in summer
is 35 per cent. ashes and 65 per cent. rubbish; in winter 75
per cent. ashes and 25 per cent. rubbish.</p>

<p class='c000'>Until recently practically all of New York City’s ash
carts carried approximately one ton. The point was made
that with this type of vehicle there is a great loss of time in
carrying the load to the dump and returning empty. William
H. Edwards, former Commissioner of Street Cleaning,
claimed that there would be a greater saving if five-ton vehicles
drawn by three horses and operated by four men were
used. Mr. Edwards said that a test had proved that six cartloads
could be collected and dumped in just about twice the
time it took for one cartload under the conditions existing
then. The city is now experimenting with motor apparatus
designed for dustless and odorless collection of all kinds of
refuse.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a few cities one type of wagon is used for ashes and
another type for rubbish. One new type of wagon has the
body swung low on running gear, with dumping edges three
feet, six inches above the pavement, and is pivoted at one
end to facilitate dumping. It holds nine cubic yards and is
divided by cross partitions into compartments, one for
ashes and the other for garbage. The relative capacity of
the compartments can be varied. Some of the types used in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>American cities are described in the accompanying tables.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some American and German cities are using, and others
are considering the purchase and use of, motor trucks for
collection purposes. It is generally agreed that motor
trucks are economical only where the haul is long. A discussion
of the merits of motor vehicles as compared with
horse drawn carts will be found in the chapter on garbage
collection. In some cities where the haul to the loading stations
is long, trucks with detachable bodies are used for
garbage, ashes and rubbish. The bodies are lifted by derricks
from the truck and placed either on the train or on
the trolley cars. In a few other cities horse-drawn wagons
are taken to a central point in a district and then as
trailers are hauled by tractors to the dumping grounds.
The best system to be adopted depends entirely upon local
conditions.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Location of Receptacles</h3>

<p class='c017'>Where should the can be taken from by the collector and
to what place returned? The answer is important for it is
one of the chief factors in determining the cost of collection.
The location seriously affects the speed of collection.
In Milwaukee it was found in 1911 that the average collector
could enter from fifty to one hundred houses in an
eight-hour day, and that the time consumed in cleaning one
house was slightly over three minutes. The Cleansing Superintendent
of London reports that a one-horse van of
four cubic yards capacity, hauling to a dump two miles
away, under normal conditions could make from 240 to
260 calls and collections each ten hours. If the can is placed
on the edge of the curb, he says, it is possible to make 500
collections a day.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some cities require that the can be carried by the residents
to the curb. Others collect from rear yard, cellar,
areaway or alley. In cities which collect during the day
and require the cans to be left at the curb serious objections
are reported because the array of cans and rubbish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>along the street on the day of collection makes the thoroughfare
unsightly. To overcome this objection several plans
have been carried out:</p>

<p class='c000'>(1) To collect at night.</p>

<p class='c000'>(2) To require that cans cannot remain on the street
more than one hour after being emptied.</p>

<p class='c000'>(3) To require collectors to go into basements and back
yards and to return the cans to these places.</p>

<p class='c000'>(4) To collect in rear alleys.</p>

<p class='c000'>Experience has shown that it is very difficult to enforce
a regulation by which cans should be taken from the curb
by householders at any particular time after they have been
emptied. In many homes the husband is the only person
who does this kind of work. The can has to be taken in the
morning to the curb. The empty, therefore, must remain
in the street until noon and if the collection is not made
until afternoon or the husband does not go home to his midday
meal, it remains there until night. Many cities report
that to eliminate the unsightliness of miscellaneous boxes,
pails, cans and barrels which line the curb on collection day
the citizens are willing to pay the extra cost of having the
collectors take the cans from the basements or rear yards
and return them to the same place. It has also been found
that rear yard collection facilitates and somewhat reduces
the cost of street cleaning.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is generally agreed that the best plan is to collect from
rear alleys, but these do not exist in many cities. In a few
places which have alleys the officials say their experience
has not been satisfactory; but in nearly every instance there
has not been found to exist any cooperation between the
collection force and the public, due to the failure of the
officials to educate the people.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Time of Collection</h3>

<p class='c017'>Usually ashes and rubbish are collected during the
working hours of the day, but often it is customary to collect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>them in the early hours of the morning, especially in
the business section.</p>

<p class='c000'>Night collection has been satisfactory in some cities. A
few having this system require cans to be placed at the curb
the night before. These are collected early in the morning
and the empty ones taken to the back yard. The principal
objection to night collections is the noise of the wagons
and the dropping of the empty metal cans.</p>

<p class='c000'>William H. Edwards, former Commissioner of Street
Cleaning in New York, gives the following advantages and
disadvantages of day and night collection:</p>

<p class='c000'>Unsightliness of cans in front of buildings much less
evident at night.</p>

<p class='c000'>Retention of cover on receptacle easier in day time.
When covers are removed day work has its disadvantages
by the spreading of the dust by the wind.</p>

<p class='c000'>Interference with sidewalk and roadway traffic less at
night.</p>

<p class='c000'>When receptacle is placed in areaway it is more difficult
for the collector to see at night whether or not there is material
to remove.</p>

<p class='c000'>Intense heat in summer is a drawback both to men and
animals in the day collections.</p>

<p class='c000'>Spilling of material is of less importance at night.</p>

<p class='c000'>Night collection necessitates the extra charge of lighting
the dump.</p>

<p class='c000'>Supervision of night collection is considerably more
difficult.</p>

<p class='c000'>Night collection was tried in New York, but was abandoned
after the strike in 1911.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Frequency of Collection</h3>

<p class='c017'>The number of collections that should be made in a
given period depends upon the amount of ashes, the density
of population, the season of the year, the climate and the
degree of cleanliness desired. Most cities collect more frequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>in winter than in summer and some collect more
often in the business districts than they do in residential
and outlying districts.</p>

<p class='c000'>Samuel A. Greeley, sanitary engineer, believes that
ashes and rubbish should be collected at least twice monthly
even in summer. Most cities do better than that, some collecting
daily and many collecting more than once a week.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Enforcement of Collection Regulations</h3>

<p class='c017'>In cities in England and on the Continent, where the
ashes, garbage and rubbish are collected together, collections
are in general made three times a week; when collected
separately, one collection a week is regarded as sufficient.</p>

<p class='c000'>Detailed regulations should be made and distributed on
cards among householders. They should include the kind
of receptacle to be used, how the waste should be prepared
to facilitate collection and where the cans should be placed.
For example, Richmond, Virginia, provides by ordinance
that the occupant of any house shall cause all ashes and
other non-combustible refuse matter to be put in receptacles
of not less than five or more than twenty-four gallons capacity.
Ashes and other non-combustible matter is construed
to mean ashes from coal and other fuel and such
material substances as may collect in connection with the
ordinary conduct of a household, but not such as may result
from building operations or repairs. Any person violating
any of these provisions must pay a fine of not less than $1
or more than $20.</p>

<p class='c000'>The enforcement of regulations is facilitated by and
grows easier with the growth and development of the collection
system and with the regularity of collection. It is always
difficult at first. The rules and regulations, a description
of the collection system and the aims of the collecting
department should be printed on cards and hung in every
household. Annual clean-up campaigns have been found
useful by officials who desire to educate the public.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>
  <h3 class='c008'>Disposal of Ashes and Rubbish</h3>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The following methods of disposal are used by cities:</p>

<p class='c000'>(1) Dumping.</p>

<p class='c000'>(2) Burning combustible rubbish that is not salable and
using the ashes to fill in low land, or for road or sidewalk
making, or selling part for use in partitions for fireproof
buildings or for laying cellar floors.</p>

<p class='c000'>(3) Incinerating with garbage.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the dumping method is used cities either own
their own dumps or secure the privilege for or without a
fee for disposing of the waste upon land privately owned.
In most cases the waste is used for fill and no fee is paid by
the city. A few seacoast cities dump their combined refuse
at sea, but this practise is condemned. Where only ashes
and rubbish are used the most common practise is to place
the rubbish and light material near the bottom and to surface
the dump to a depth of several feet with ashes. This
makes a neat and finished appearance. Where ashes, rubbish
and garbage are collected and dumped together, many
cities have found that the so-called sanitary fill method, described
in the chapter on garbage, is the most satisfactory.
It is becoming more and more difficult for cities to maintain
dumps on account of the congestion of population,
which forces the municipality to seek disposal places far
away from the centers, thus increasing the length of haul.
If paper, garbage and combustibles are allowed on the
dump, fires are apt to result and these make odors and
smoke which are unpleasant and unhealthful. These fires
are often very difficult to extinguish, especially if the dump
is a deep one. Iron cages are sometimes used at the dump
for burning the valueless combustible rubbish.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some cities are successfully operating incinerating
plants for the destruction of garbage and combustible rubbish;
others have plants which burn the garbage and rubbish
and a part of the ashes. Where ashes are burned they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>collected with the rubbish and garbage in those districts
nearest to the incinerating plant in order to reduce the
length of haul.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Revenue from By-Products</h3>

<p class='c017'>Many cities as yet make no effort to secure and dispose
of the by-products, which consist of metal, rags, paper, tin
cans, bottles, and ashes; in others the problem is being studied
seriously. In comparatively few considerable revenue
is derived. Generally junk dealers are allowed to overrun
the dump and select what they want. A few cities
charge for this privilege, the price being determined by bidding.
The cities which derive the most revenue are those
which do the sorting and selling themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>The St. Paul Sanitation Committee came to the conclusion
that 33 per cent. of rubbish has value and that of this
salable material 80 per cent. is paper, 10 per cent. rags, 5
per cent. tin cans, 3 per cent. bottles and 2 per cent. is miscellaneous.
It says further: “The best authorities agree
that in cities of 500,000 or over the recovery and utilization
of wastes may result in some profit, but in cities of less
population the amount recovered will not warrant the construction
of expensive plants to make the separation and
recovery.” In the smaller places some revenue can usually
be secured by letting out to junk dealers the privilege of
picking over the dump.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been estimated that in New York City 48 per cent.
of a ton of rubbish is worth $1.44 to the picking contractor
and the remaining 52 per cent. is worth at least $1.25 when
burned and transformed into electrical energy.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been suggested in one or two large cities that the
unskilled and handicapped labor out of employment and
seeking city aid be employed on dumps to pick out the unconsumed
coal from the ashes screened automatically. Besides
furnishing employment at any season of the year, it
is claimed that coal in paying quantities could be secured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>for municipal consumption. This claim is based on the reports
of experts who have analyzed ashes and found the
amount of unburned coal to run as high as 24½ per cent.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Passaic, New Jersey, the papers, rags, etc., are picked
out at the dump by junk dealers. In Cincinnati, Ohio, the
revenue from salable rubbish has been over $2,000 a year.
Evanston, Illinois, which dumps its ashes on the river
front, was compelled to find some way of disposing of its
waste paper so that it would not scatter through the neighborhood.
A baling press was put into service and it is reported
by the city that excellent results followed. The city
collects and bales the paper in both business and residential
districts. The paper is placed in gunny sacks and these are
hung just inside the alley gate, or barn or stable on the
morning of the designated day. It is said this system (1)
takes a day’s work each week from the routes of each of
six men who collect rubbish on the east side of the city; (2)
prevents the blowing of loose paper about the street and
alley and in the neighborhood of the dump; (3) pays for
the operation of the press and leaves a balance to aid the
rest of the service. A man, employed eight hours a day,
drives the wagon and presses the paper. Camden, New
Jersey, which keeps its ashes separate, collects its rubbish
and paper, and takes them to a sorting place. Prisoners
in the city jail for minor offenses are kept busy sorting and
baling the rags and paper. Nearly a million pounds of
paper were baled and sold in one year. Cleveland in one
year spent $230,000 for removal of its ashes and rubbish,
and received $30,000 from the sale of the material sorted
from its rubbish. The paper was sold for $5.60 a ton in bags
at the plant of a boxboard company. Tin cans were sold
for $5 a ton loaded on cars and delivered to a company making
silk skirts. The metal, bottles, rags, etc., were sold to
local dealers under competitive bidding. The rubbish not
valuable was used for fill. The caretakers of dumps are
expected to recover the salable portions of the rubbish. One
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>of the small New York cities gives the privilege of sorting
the dump to a man who in payment therefor acts as caretaker
of the dump. A few cities sell their ashes to contractors
for cellar floors and partitions in fireproof building.</p>

<p class='c000'>The high prices paid for reclaimable rubbish since the
war began and the demand of the Federal Government that
nothing be wasted have caused many cities to give much attention
to the matter of rescuing salable rubbish.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cleveland’s specifications for picking the scrap materials
from the various city dumps contain among other provisions
the following:</p>

<p class='c000'>“The successful bidder and his employees shall have
free access to the dumps and shall have the exclusive right
to gather and sell or remove the salable refuse, scrap and
other waste material, except the soil, earth and ashes, for
the period of one year; but nothing herein contained shall
be construed to give the successful bidder the right to charge
either the cities or other parties for dumping on such
dumps.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Superintendent of the Division of Street Cleaning
shall have complete supervision of the dumps and shall designate
what material and refuse shall be deposited on the
dumps and the manner and the places where such deposits
shall be made; and should he deem it necessary shall have
the right to place Street Cleaning Department employees
on the dumps to supervise such dumping.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The successful bidder shall shovel and level all refuse
or materials and shall keep the dumps clean and free from
nuisance of all kinds. He shall be responsible for all damages
caused by the dumps and shall extinguish all fires which
shall arise thereon.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The successful bidder if he desires to store or pile upon
the dumps any refuse, scrap or waste material, which he
may gather shall pile or store it at places designated by the
Superintendent of the Division of Street Cleaning or his
employees and any material or stores so piled shall be removed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>within ten days (10) after the expiration of the contract,
and if not removed within that time shall be the property
of the city.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The City reserves the rights to use the dumps for any
purpose whatsoever in such manner as not to interfere with
the picking, gathering and carting away of waste material
by the successful bidder.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The contractor shall pay to the city on or before the
15th day of each month, the amount due for the use of the
dumps during the previous months. On failure of the contractor
to make payment to the city within the specified
time, The Director of Public Service may declare the contract
forfeited and refuse the contractor the further use of
the dumps and may hold the contractor and his surety for
the full amount due the city.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In case the contract is forfeited the city reserves the
right and the bidder agrees that the city shall have the right
to let out in the open market or otherwise, the use of such
dumps, and if the price thereon realized is less than that
specified in the contract with the successful bidder, the difference
in price, together with any additional expense incurred
in arranging for the letting out to other parties, will be
charged to the contractor and his surety.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Should it become necessary for the city to abandon
dumping on any or all of the dumps herein specified, the city
shall notify the contractor in writing that dumping is to be
discontinued on such dump or dumps, and in such case the
contract covering such dump or dumps is to be terminated
with the closing of the dumps, and the contractor shall pay
the city for any fraction of the month which he may have
picked from such dump or dumps.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The city reserves the right to reject any or all bids or
part of any bid.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The following specifications explain how Los Angeles,
California, cares for its rubbish dumps and obtains a revenue:</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>“The service required by these specifications is to furnish
facilities for disposing of the non-combustible rubbish
collected from that portion of the city south of the summit
of the Cahuenga Pass, north of Manchester Avenue, and
east of a line parallel to and three hundred (300) feet distant
westerly from Beechwood Avenue, in that portion of
the city known as the Palms Annex, for a period of four
years from April 20, 1917.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The contractor shall maintain a dumping ground for
the rubbish, which said dumping ground shall be accessible
at all seasons of the year by one or more suitable graded and
surfaced streets or roads. The location of the dumping
ground must be such that in the opinion of the Board of
Public Works it will not be unduly objectionable to the
public.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The unloading points within the grounds must be convenient
of access for all vehicles used by the city for rubbish
transportation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The rubbish will be brought to the dumping ground by
the city, will be unloaded by the city at such readily accessible
points as the contractor shall designate, and will, after
unloading, become the property of the contractor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The contractor shall keep the dumping grounds in an
orderly condition and shall so direct the dumping as to
avoid congestion of vehicles or delay to same on the dump.
He shall not use the dump for storing material in a manner
which will interfere with the passage of the city’s vehicles.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In case accidents or conditions beyond the control of
the contractor temporarily deprive him of the use of his
facilities for disposing of the rubbish the city will, upon
notification by the contractor of his inability to receive it,
dispose of it elsewhere, and charge the contractor twenty-five
(25) cents per load of ten cubic yards for the disposal
of same.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In case the contractor fails to pay the city for the disposal
of such rubbish from the hereinabove described district
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>as the contractor is unable to receive the contract may
be declared forfeited.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bidders shall name a price per month which they will
pay for the privilege of having the entire output of non-combustible
rubbish from the above described territory
dumped on their ground.”</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Efficiency Tests and Suggestions</h3>

<p class='c017'>A simple and effective plan for keeping accurate records
is a great help in checking up the efficiency of a collecting
force. In fact, records are imperative if any attempt is
made to operate economically, for the cost is influenced by
the many and small details of the work. A systematic record
of all complaints should be kept and the activity of each
collector should be definitely checked up. Some suggest
that complaints should be recorded in a loose leaf ledger
and a slip handed to the driver of the particular district
from which the complaint comes. As an offset to the citizens’
complaints the ledger should have leaves adjoining
giving the reports of the driver. By referring to the ledger
the complaint clerk can explain to the citizen why he is not
receiving service. Others suggest that records should be
kept of the daily, weekly and monthly work of each collector
so that work of the various collectors may be equalized.
They also suggest that there be recorded for each district
the number of loads collected, miles traveled and complaints
made. Some suggest a card system with cross index as more
convenient than a ledger.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following scheme has been suggested to check up
the amount of work done: W, number of collection wagons;
V, capacity of one wagon in cubic feet; F, interval between
collection in days; T, time required to collect from one
house expressed as part of an hour; C, percentage of working
time spent by collectors in the actual time of collecting
as distinguished from hauling to and from the point of disposal;
D, length of working day in hours; S, number of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>trips to point of disposal per wagon per day; P, total population;
N, average number of people per house; R, daily
quantity of refuse per capita-cubic foot; g, daily quantity of
garbage per capita-cubic foot; d, daily quantity of rubbish
per capita-cubic foot:</p>

<p class='c000'>The person making this suggestion says it is frequently easy
for a superintendent to determine how much time his collectors
are spending unproductively in going to and from
the dump. He should also be able, he says, to determine
quite accurately the frequency of collection, total refuse,
capacity of wagon and average number of trips per wagon
per day. With this data he can estimate from Equation
No. 1 the time required to collect from one house. If
excessive he may find it advisable to secure better cooperation
between the collector and the housewife.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Per Capita Production</h3>

<p class='c017'>Any attempt to estimate the local ash production of a
community based on the experience of any other city will
end in failure unless all peculiar conditions in both are
known and compared. Some authorities say that the rubbish
and ashes produced per capita is from 325 to 530 lbs.
a year. The following table gives the figures for some large
cities:</p>

Rubbish collection in unlimited amount from residences and not exceeding 4 barrels from retail business houses.

<p class='c017'>An effort to compare the unit cost of collection and disposal
in one city with that in another will prove to be most
unsatisfactory for the reason that local conditions make
necessary different methods, length of haul and systems,
and these affect the cost of operation. Also, there are very
few cities which keep any accurate and detailed cost data.</p>

<p class='c000'>Reports from thirteen cities which collect ashes and rubbish
by municipal forces show that the average cost of collection
and disposal for 1916 was $0.4018 per cubic yard, the
highest being $.72, and the lowest $.1025. Five other cities

<p class='c007'>Local conditions are so variable that the problem of collecting
and disposing of garbage is one of the most complex
with which city officials have to deal. The results obtained
by one city cannot in detail be applied to another city, although
there are many characteristics common to all. Each
city must study its conditions and then apply general principles
with such modifications as its peculiarities make
necessary.</p>

<p class='c000'>The garbage problem divides itself into two natural
divisions:</p>

<p class='c031'>1. Collection, including house treatment and haul.</p>

<p class='c031'>2. Final disposal.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two are so closely related that the cost of different
systems should be compared on the basis of combined cost

<h3 class='c008'>Types of Collection Systems</h3>

<p class='c017'>There are two types of garbage collection systems—the
separate and the combined. Before deciding which is the
better adapted to local conditions the method of disposal of
all municipal waste—rubbish, ashes, dead animals, street
sweepings and stable manure—must be considered. A further
study should be made of the five combinations which
have been adopted by American cities and which are outlined
in the chapter on ash and rubbish collection. When
garbage is collected separately, the method of disposing of
it is by the reduction process, incineration or feeding to
hogs. If it is collected with rubbish the two wastes must
be incinerated. If ashes, rubbish and garbage are collected
together the wastes are either dumped or incinerated.</p>

<p class='c000'>As with ashes, reports generally agree, that if all wastes
are collected together as a rule the cost of collection will be
less than if each is collected separately. The method of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>final disposal, the net cost of that method after deducting
revenues, and the length of haul should be considered and
carefully determined before any system of collection is
adopted. The same arguments presented in the chapter
about ash collection for and against the combined and separate
methods of gathering ashes apply with equal force to
the collection of garbage.</p>

<p class='c000'>Robert H. Wylde, sanitary expert, advocates the mixed
collection. He says: “There can be no doubt that the
mixed collection is preferable from practically every point
of view and possesses such great advantages that it is doubtful
if it is ever compensated for (from the citizen’s point
of view) by economies realized from any method of disposal
requiring separate collection.” He also points out that for
a separate collection, a city must have three distinct styles
of carts, collections should be made in the early morning or
during the night, and each house should be visited daily or
at least every other day. Householders must be required to
keep the materials in three separate receptacles; three calls
must be made at each house and the same ground must be
covered by three different classes of collector.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Chicago City Waste Report, by I. S. Osborn and
J. T. Fetherston, says that combined collection requires
more frequent collection of ashes and rubbish than if garbage
were collected separately. If separate collection of
garbage is made a more frequent collection of garbage and
a less frequent collection of rubbish and ashes can be made.
If all wastes are collected together, it says, as a rule the unit
cost for collection will be less than if collected separately.</p>

<p class='c000'>In smaller communities, says Samuel A. Greeley, sanitary
expert, it does not seem advisable to place all classes
of refuse in one receptacle as ashes can be easily disposed
of. By separating the garbage the bulk to be removed is
smaller, the disposal by burial requires less land, much of
the garbage can be sent to the farms for feeding, and the
general cost of refuse disposal is reduced without seriously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>lowering the efficiency. In cities of from 30,000 to 50,000,
he asserts, the mixed system requiring only one can at a
house and permitting incineration without the use of additional
fuel, has many advantages. In such small communities,
he believes, garbage does not have the advantages for
reduction purposes that it has for the larger cities.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Methods of Collection</h3>

<p class='c017'>There are three methods of collecting garbage:</p>

<p class='c000'>(1) <em>License System</em>, by which the city licenses certain
cartmen, the individuals paying the expenses, usually under
regulation of the Board of Health.</p>

<p class='c000'>(2) <em>Contract System</em>, which provides that city pay a
fixed amount annually for service, that certain schedule be
paid by householder, or that contractor pay a certain
amount to the city for privilege of collecting, and charging
the householder for the service.</p>

<p class='c000'>(3) <em>Municipal System</em>, by which the city does work with
own or hired teams. In some cities, city employees collect a
part and scavengers or collectors, or both, collect the remainder.</p>

<p class='c000'>Experts are generally agreed that the best of the three
systems is the last. They say that there is always much
trouble when the contractor is allowed to collect pay from
citizens served, and that to sanitary officers must be given
full authority to fine those who fail to have garbage removed.
Contractors’ wagons also must be under the close
supervision of sanitary officers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Chicago Waste Commission’s report says that efficient
service can be obtained by contract when the work is
specified and the requirements are such as to obligate the
contractor to furnish the desired service. The contractor,
it asserts, must maintain an effective organization, sufficiently
equipped and managed to be able to render proper
service. Under this method, it points out, a rigid inspection
is necessary on the part of the city and full compliance on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>the part of the contractor in carrying out his agreement.
The report also says that efficient service can be obtained
by a municipal collection when the city conducts the work
with its own teams and equipment and the men employed
on the work are directly responsible to their superiors who
in turn are responsible to the public for the service rendered.
It gives the following advantages of this method:</p>

<p class='c000'>(a) The service is rendered as desired. It is not necessary
to specify how and what work is to be done, but the
work can be conducted so as to meet conditions as they may
arise.</p>

<p class='c000'>(b) The work comes directly under the control of the
officials whose chief object is to render satisfactory service
at a reasonable cost.</p>

<p class='c000'>(c) Better equipment can be provided and the work
planned on a more systematic basis when investments are
permanent.</p>

<p class='c000'>(d) Municipal operation eliminates the tendency on
the part of the contractors (when the work is done by contract)
to obtain the largest remuneration possible at the
least cost.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is impossible, says the report, to develop efficient
organization or to render the best service in collection with
hired teams where the driver receives his pay from the employer,
who in turn receives his pay from the city for furnishing
the team and driver.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the majority of cities in the United States, the collection
is done by the city, which owns its equipment and
conducts the work under the supervision of its officials. It
has been the experience of these cities that the results of
municipal operation have, in most cases, proven satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c000'>John H. Gregory, sanitary expert, believes that as a
general rule the best results may be expected from municipal
ownership and operation of collection equipment. A
similar opinion is expressed in the report of the Special
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Commission on the Collection of Municipal Waste, Worcester,
Massachusetts.</p>

<p class='c000'>Grand Rapids, Michigan, reports that under the municipal
system, the cost per householder is $1.63 a year, while
under the private contract system the cost was $3.00 a year.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whatever system and method are selected to make it
successful a city must (1) provide sufficient appropriation;
(2) secure or insist upon an efficient organization; (3) have
or require sanitary and economical methods of work, and
(4) secure and foster cooperation on the part of the public.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>House Treatment</h3>

<p class='c017'>Many cities require that garbage be drained and some
that it be wrapped in paper as well as drained. Wrapping
aids combustion when the disposal is by incineration.
Wheeling, West Virginia, claims that wrapping garbage
eliminates smell, preserves can, provides fuel and makes
work much less unpleasant for the collector. Dr. P. M.
Hall and Samuel A. Greeley advocate wrapping if garbage
is burned. Seven cities, of those from which statistics have
been received, require that garbage be wrapped—Dunkirk,
Jamestown, Mount Vernon, Trenton, Milwaukee, Grand
Rapids and Minneapolis.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Organization</h3>

<p class='c017'>It is agreed that the number and location of districts
into which a city is divided must depend upon the size, topography
and population, the location of sub-stations or the
place of final disposal, the frequency of collection and the
hauling equipment. It is also agreed that the divisions
should be made with the purpose of shortening the haul as
much as possible and to avoid steep grades with loaded wagons.
Some cities haul direct from the district to the place
of disposal, others establish loading stations or bunkers to
which the garbage is hauled in wagons and from which it
is taken for disposal in automobiles, train or trolley. Still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>others have loaded wagons taken to a central place and from
there hauled by tractors to the place of disposal.</p>

<p class='c000'>The type of equipment, system of collection, organization
of city, location of receptacles, frequency of collection
and hours of removal must be considered when organizing
the force. These vitally affect the cost. Some cities require
one man to act as driver and collector. This system is regarded
as uneconomical as the whole collection is retarded.
Other cities have two men with a wagon, one to drive and
the other to collect. In some cities the gang system, described
in the chapter on ash collection, is used.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Chicago Waste Commission makes these recommendations
to insure an effective organization:</p>

<p class='c000'>1. Individual responsibility for work assigned.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. Employees should be paid for work performed instead
of for hours of labor.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. Published records of employees individually by sections
under foremen and by districts under inspectors or
superintendents will create a healthy rivalry and conduce to
better work.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. Unit cost of all work should be maintained and the
keeping of these records will more than pay for the cost of
the clerical work involved.</p>

<p class='c000'>All agree that special effort should be made to get intelligent
drivers who are willing to take pains to do the work
at each house in a cleanly fashion. Others urge keeping one
man on the same route.</p>

<p class='c000'>In planning districts and force, the findings of the Chicago
Civil Service Commission may assist some officials. It
required on an average under ordinary conditions three
hours and fifty-five minutes to collect a full load of two
and one-half tons. The average in summer was 3.9 hours
and in winter 4.7 hours. The average rate of haul was 3
miles per hour in summer and 2.7 miles per hour in winter.
Collections were at a minimum in winter and a maximum in
summer, especially in September. The quantity collected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>from several districts for different years was not constant,
but continually decreased or increased, depending upon local
conditions, such as change of character of population,
growth of residence, business and manufacturing. The
fluctuations make it necessary that the organization be
flexible and easily adapted to changing conditions.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the quantity will vary from season to season, the
collector assigned to a district should make daily reports of
work performed and territory covered. By so doing it can
easily be determined whether he is delinquent or the work
has increased so as to require auxiliary equipment or extra
assistance. The plan is also valuable for rearranging districts.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Ohio State Board of Health has expressed the belief
that the routes should be so arranged that each collector
covers about the same mileage and so that each wagon
is as near as possible to the point of disposal by the
time the wagon is loaded in order that the productive time
of the collector, or the time he spends in collecting from
houses, may be as great as possible and his unproductive
time, or the time he spends in driving his loaded wagon to
the point of disposal, as small as possible. In some cities,
owing to poor routing, the unproductive time has been as
high as 40 per cent. of the collector’s working hours.
Routes should also be so arranged that grades are climbed
with light loads and descended with heavy loads.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Receptacles and Vehicles</h3>

<p class='c017'>Most cities specify a standard sized can. It is agreed
that this is necessary to secure the best results. The size
varies in different cities and with the type of system. All
reports show that the can should be metallic, water-tight and
as nearly air-tight as possible, and should be securely covered.
A 20-gallon can, it is claimed, will take care of an
average size family for a week and is easily handled by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>collector. The size of the can should be limited so as to be
easily handled by one man.</p>

<p class='c000'>For collecting garbage many types of wagons are being
used by American cities. The design materially affects the
cost and efficiency of results. Most cities are now using a
steel tank wagon with either a bottom or rear dump, depending
upon the house treatment of the garbage and
whether the system is combined or separate. All reports
show that any garbage wagon to be sanitary and satisfactory
must be metallic, fitted with covers, easily cleaned and
disinfected, and as large as consistent with the grades and
type of pavement on the routes traversed. Particular attention
should be given to the loading height. This should
be at a convenient distance from the ground so that the collector
can easily empty the can. The arrangements for
dumping are also important. They should be quick and
simple. It is claimed that bottom dumping wagons are
best, but these cannot be used for raw garbage unless
wrapped. They can be used for mixed refuse. Many cities
successfully use the rear dump wagon, which is tilted by a
hand-turned gear at front.</p>

<p class='c000'>The right kind of cover is also important. Greeley says
the most satisfactory cover is the light fixed roof, arched
over the top of the wagon at sufficient height to give a free
space above the whole of the garbage, and to allow trap doors
in the side of the wagon for emptying the can. Many cities
use canvas covers. The Worcester Waste Commission reports
that its inquiries show that wooden or iron covers are
impracticable because they do not allow expansion of load
during periods when the amount of garbage is greatest. It
says that wooden covers warp, do not fit tightly and need
repairs often and are much in the way during collection.
Iron covers, it avers, are almost universally condemned on
account of their weight, and if very light get out of shape
easily, wear loose and in a short time become a noisy nuisance.
Some types of wagons are equipped with rubber buffers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>to lessen the noise and others have automatic covers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Wagons made for garbage collection range in cost from
$150 to $375 each.</p>

<p class='c000'>The capacity of the average garbage wagon has been from
a yard to two yards cubic contents. The tendency in many
large cities is to increase this to four and five yards and even
larger. Greeley believes that a wagon having a capacity of
about three cubic yards is desirable.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few cities which have adopted the can collection system
have wagons built with two tiers. Some are using automobile
trucks constructed in this way. The Ohio State
Board of Health, in its report, says that platform wagons
are somewhat less economical than tank wagons but are entirely
suited for small cities where the quantity is not large.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seems to be the opinion of those who have had experience
that automobile trucks for refuse collection are
neither economical nor convenient, owing to the many stops
and starts and the slow general progress. None of the 224
cities from which data have been received uses automobile
trucks exclusively. Several have automobile trucks in service
but practically all of these use them for hauling from
transfer stations over long distances to the place of disposal.
At some of these loading stations a crane is used to
lift the detachable body or tank from the wagon and place
it on the truck. Another method adopted by a few cities is
to use wagons for collection and tractors for hauling. The
horse drawn wagons when filled are taken from a common
meeting place to the disposal site by a tractor which draws
them as a trailer. The horses are hitched to empty wagons
and continue collecting.</p>

<p class='c000'>R. T. Dana has compiled statistics which will interest
those who contemplate using motor trucks. He says for
hauling ashes, street pavement, etc., it is cheaper to use
horses if the haul is less than one mile. If motor power is
used for a haul of a quarter of a mile the loss is 1.8 per
cent.; if half a mile, 9.1 per cent. loss. For one mile haul
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>there is no difference in cost. Above that the saving is in
favor of motor trucks. Similar investigations have been
made at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. These
show that for distances greater than 1.7 miles, electric
driven vehicles are cheaper than either horse drawn or
gasoline driven and that gasoline driven are cheaper than
horse drawn.</p>

<p class='c000'>Investigations made by the Efficiency Division of the
Chicago Civil Service Commission showed that electric trucks
are more efficient than gasoline trucks where the short hauls
with many stops are encountered. Its conclusion was that
for the long hauls electric trucks were more economical than
horse drawn or gasoline driven trucks. The following table
gives a detailed comparison of the advantages of gasoline
and electric trucks as determined by the Commission:</p>

<p class='c000'>The Commission’s study led to the following conclusion:
“That at the present prevailing cost of team hire the saving
in the use of electric motor trucks for hauling garbage in
such wards as have a considerable haul, would amount to
5.1 per cent. of the total cost of removing such garbage by
teams. 2. That either the gasoline or electric power trucks
can handle the hauling of garbage with approximately equal
satisfaction. 3. That the more economical power truck has
been found to be electric. This is governed in a measure
by the low cost rate of electrical energy from the Sanitary
District to the city for night power and by the fact that the
rates for depreciation, maintenance, repair and insurance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>are less than for the gasoline truck. 4. That the haul below
which an electric truck carrying three tons would not be economical
when measured against a $5.50 per day team is
found to be about 1.8 miles and when measured against a $6
per day team is 0.8 miles. 5. That the three ton gasoline
truck at present cost price would not haul economically when
traveling in the city at the economical rate of speed, as
would the horse drawn vehicle at either $5.50 or $6 per
day and traveling at the rate of speed found by experiment
on garbage wagons.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Greeley believes that the cost of loading a motor truck
will be greater per hour and the rate of load will have to
be increased proportionately to make the cost comparable
with loading a team drawn wagon. The cost of hauling by
motor will be less. He contends that the use of trucks in
refuse collection service will increase and that the cost of
loading can be reduced by limiting the motor truck to transportation
after the loading of the wagon by the tractor and
trailer system.</p>

<p class='c000'>St. Louis recently made computations comparing the existing
cost of hauling garbage from the long haul district
with mule teams and the probable cost of haul with or by
tractors. The motor apparatus was assumed to be a Knox
tractor with two trailers and the assumed haul of seven
miles. This would replace ten teams. The investment for
a ten-ton tractor would be $3,750, and two trailers, $1,000,
with a total of $4,750 for the motor apparatus. Ten teams
of mules cost $3,000 and ten wagons, $1,350, a total for animal
power of $4,350. The cost of operating per day is assumed
to be for the motor, making three trips a day, 42
miles, $4.07.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>This computation assumes a loading station located at
the center of the long-haul district, which, including lot,
building, paving, platform, sewer and water connections,
would cost $6,300. The equipment would therefore be $10,650.
Interest on the investment is computed at 6 per cent.
The annual charges against the motor equipment would
therefore become $3,034.92. The year is assumed at 156
days, as the district is collected from three times a week.
The charges against the team equipment amount to
$6,503.88. The saving in adopting the truck system is thus
$3,468.96 a year from this long-haul district. Under these
assumptions the equipment is idle one-half the time.</p>

<p class='c000'>The New York City Department of Street Cleaning
made a test of motor trucks and proved their efficiency over
the present system, giving a possible 18 per cent. for time
lost in hauling, loading and returning light as against 43
per cent. under the existing system. A ten-year test in
England proved the superiority of motor trucks.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Worcester Commission reports that for heavy, long
hauls and under conditions where a truck can be kept moving,
a motor truck is probably more economical than a horse
drawn vehicle of the same capacity. It concludes that the
motor trucks are not economical for short hauls with many
stops.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Health Commissioner of Seattle in 1913 made the
claim that auto trucks save from one-fourth to one-fifth as
much time as is consumed by horse drawn vehicles. He expressed
the belief that 45 cents on a dollar is saved by using
auto trucks. Seattle hauls its garbage by auto from bunkers
to place of final disposal.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few cities haul from transfer stations to place of final
disposal by trolley and steam cars and by barges. Greeley
estimates that assuming 600 cu. yds. of refuse weigh 375
tons, the cost of trolley transportation will be 40 cents per
ton. Barge transportation, he estimates, will be about 22
cents per ton. Transportation by steam railroads, he says,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>depends upon switching charges. These will range from $5
to $15 per car. He figures the switching charges will average
about 20 cents per ton.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Collection Regulations</h3>

<p class='c017'>The location of the receptacle and the time and frequency
of collection have a very important bearing on the
efficiency and cost of the service. The degree of cleanliness
desired and the convenience of the householder are the chief
factors which determine these questions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Most cities specify where the can must be left for collection
and to what place it must be returned. Some collect
from the curb, areaway or alley, but the majority of them
take the can from and return it to the house or back yard.
Garbage can be collected much more speedily if the cans
are left at the curb for collection days, but most cities object
to the unsightliness of the thoroughfares which results.
The citizens, for their own convenience, and to eliminate
the objection of a littered street, are willing to pay the extra
cost of having the garbage taken from the yard or the house.</p>

<p class='c000'>The almost universal practise in America is to collect
garbage during the daytime. Of those from which facts
have been received and whose systems are described in the
accompanying tables, only two collect all garbage at night.
One collects at night during the summer and four collect
at night in the business section. Two collect during both
day and night.</p>

<p class='c000'>The number of collections made in a stated period of
time depends entirely upon the amount of garbage, the
density and character of population, the climate and the
season of the year. Some cities maintain a daily service in
all except the outlying sections. Practically all collect at
least once a week. In cold climates more collections are
required during the summer than during the winter.
Usually the collections are more frequent in the business
sections than in the residential sections and less frequent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>in the outlying districts than in the residential sections,
the density of population being the determining factor.</p>

<p class='c000'>As with ash collection the promulgation and enforcement
of specific regulations are very helpful in increasing
or maintaining the efficiency of a garbage collection system.
Cooperation of the public is essential and this can be secured
to a great extent by an efficient system. All reports
agree that regular collections should be made at stated intervals
and so far as possible at the same time each day according
to a regular schedule. Laxity on the part of the
collection department will breed indifference among the
householders. The Chicago Waste Commission expresses
the opinion that where the householders become accustomed
to a systematic service they will depend upon the collector
and will more readily comply with laws and ordinances. All
experts agree that the regulation as to house treatment of
refuse should not only be enforced, but that considerable
time should be spent by officials in educating and training
people to cooperate for mutual advantage. Such time will
be well spent, and eventually it will reduce the cost of operation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rules and regulations respecting the collection of
garbage and refuse in a small progressive New York State
city are as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>“All persons intending to have their ashes, garbage and
other refuse removed by the collector, shall provide sufficient
standard ash cans, sixteen to twenty inches in diameter,
and twenty-six inches high, manufactured of galvanized iron
with proper handles and cover.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Into this can should be put old bottles, rubbers, tin cans,
broken bottles and glass, old shoes, sweepings, paper and
other rubbish.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ash cans containing swill, water, offensive and decomposing
material, or the contents of which are frozen and not
easily removed, will not be emptied by the collector.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Provide sufficient garbage cans composed of galvanized,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>G. I. Standard make, with covers and handles, to hold
one week’s accumulation. Put into this can all swill and
other kitchen refuse. Garbage cans containing ashes, old
bottles, tin cans, glass, shoes, sweepings, paper or other
rubbish, or the contents of which are frozen, will not be
emptied by the collector.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The cans must be placed where the collector can conveniently
have access to them, and if placed on the sidewalk
or in front yard, must be returned as soon as emptied.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The collector will collect but once each week and on
the day and at the time specified for the street on which you
reside.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Burn as much rubbish, paper, sweepings, etc., as possible.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Piles or accumulations of garbage, old bottles, tins, papers
and any other substances, liquid or solid, or of anything
that may become a breeding place for flies or mosquitoes,
or which in any way may become a nuisance, are
prohibited.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Accumulations of garbage or other refuse of more than
one week is prohibited.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Any incivility on the part of any collector, or any complaint
should be made at once in writing to the Clerk of the
city.”</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Cost of Collection</h3>

<p class='c017'>The cost of collection is vitally affected by so many different
factors and by local conditions that any attempt to
compare the economy of the system in one city with that in
another will generally be unsatisfactory. Also actual cost
data are kept by very few cities, and where they are available
the methods of determining them often vary so that
they are misleading for comparative purposes. The cost
depends upon the cost of loading and the cost of hauling, as
described in the discussion of ash collection. Such facts
about the cost as are available in printed reports and as
have been sent to the New York State Bureau of Municipal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>Information by the cities will be found in the accompanying
table.</p>

<p class='c000'>An investigation by the Ohio State Board of Health in
Ohio cities showed that the cost averaged from $2 to $2.75
per ton. The report says that the cost of collection in Cleveland
for several years averaged $2.17 to $2.79 per ton; Dayton,
$2.11; Zanesville, $2.13. In the smaller cities where
hauls are comparatively short, the cost frequently did not
exceed $1.50 per ton, and “on the average with proper routing
should not exceed $2.00 per ton.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The cost of the collection and disposal may be met by a
draft on the general fund, by assessment upon property
benefited, or by assessment upon the people directly served.
The particular method selected will be determined by the
legal limitations, the difficulty of collection, tax limitations,
and so forth.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Per Capita Production</h3>

<p class='c017'>Experts have agreed within fifty pounds as to the per
capita garbage output of a community. W. F. Morse, Sanitary
Expert, gave one hundred and ninety pounds per capita
per year as approximate figures for an estimate. William
N. Venable estimated the annual amount per capita to be
from 150 to 200 pounds.</p>

<p class='c000'>Recent reports from six cities which have complete collection
systems show considerable variation in the per capita
amount collected. These cities report as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>The average weight of garbage per cubic yard according
to statistics from nine large American cities has been from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>1,100 to 1,475 pounds, and the number of pounds per one
thousand of population per day from 331 to 875.</p>

<p class='c000'>The food conservation campaign throughout the nation
since our entry into the world-wide war, however, has created
havoc with garbage production figures and estimates.
Although it was known for many years that the American
housewife has been a most notorious profligate in the waste
of food, it was not until the war forced upon America the
necessity for food conservation that there was any decrease
in the contents of the garbage pail. Remarkable changes
have been reported by cities, the following reductions by
New York State cities being typical:</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Omaha, Nebraska, reports that for the year 1917 the bulk
of garbage was about the same as the previous year, but
that no meats, bread or potatoes were found in it. The collection
of garbage has been a little over one-third less since
the conservation of food went into effect.</p>

<p class='c000'>What percentage of this reduction will continue after
the war is problematical, but it is agreed by all experts that
never again will the American garbage pail be so productive
as it has been in the past.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Garbage Disposal</h3>

<p class='c017'>A choice of seven methods is offered for the disposal of
garbage. They are feeding to swine, dumping on land,
dumping into large volumes of water, disposing by sanitary
fill, burial, incineration and reduction. In selecting its disposal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>system a city should bear in mind the importance and
cost of a collection system.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some cities collect and dispose of their garbage by contract,
others collect by contract and dispose of it themselves,
or vice versa, and still others have all the work done by the
municipality. Experience has proved that a city can operate
a disposal plant just as efficiently as they can a collection
system.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Feeding to Swine</h3>

<p class='c017'>Most of the smaller cities in this country dispose of a
part of or all their garbage by feeding to swine, but so far as
the State Bureau of Municipal Information has been able
to learn, only four maintain municipal piggeries. These are
Worcester, New Haven, Brockton, and Taunton, Massachusetts.
The others either collect their garbage by contract
and sell it or give it to farmers or those operating piggeries,
or maintain a municipal collection and sell to a contractor
who maintains a piggery.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the cities which dispose of their garbage by feeding
to pigs and derive a revenue are the following:</p>

<p class='c010'>Denver, Colo.—Collected by a Hog Growers’ Association
which disposes of it by feeding.</p>

<p class='c010'>Cambridge, Mass.—Sells to hog farmers at 70¢. per cd.
foot and has no difficulty in disposing of all. Cost of
collection, $50,000 a year; receipts, $16,000 a year.</p>

<p class='c010'>Grand Rapids, Mich.—Sold to live stock company for
45¢. per ton f. o. b. cars. Last year collection cost
$28,659 and receipts were $4,450.20.</p>

<p class='c010'>Camden, N. J.—Incinerator burned and since then garbage
has been collected and fed to hogs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Brockton, Mass.—Municipal piggery (description below).</p>

<p class='c010'>Colorado Springs, Colo.—Contractor pays $1,440 a year
for the privilege of removing all table refuse from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>city. Feeds to hogs. Garbage must be sterilized before
feeding.</p>

<p class='c010'>Salem, Mass.—City Poor Farm uses about 200 loads a
year. Remainder is sold to contractor, who pays
$13,255 for five years. Last year city paid $10,948.30
for collection.</p>

<p class='c010'>Taunton, Mass.—Municipal piggery.</p>

<p class='c010'>Somerville, Mass.—Sold to farmers for 50¢. per cord
foot. Cost of collection last year, $25,134.80; receipts,
$8,865.50.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lawrence, Mass.—Sold for $1.25 a load. Ready and
increasing demand. Two loads used daily at Poor
Farm piggery. Cost of collection, $10,000 a year.
Estimated receipts, $6,000 a year.</p>

<p class='c010'>New Haven, Conn.—Cost of collection, $18,000 a year.
Fed to hogs on farm owned by city (description below).</p>

<p class='c010'>Fall River, Mass.—City pays contractor $7,800 a year
for the removal of garbage. He feeds it to pigs on
farm owned by him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Worcester, Mass.—Municipal piggery (description below).</p>

<p class='c010'>Corning, N. Y.—Contractor pays city $122 a year for
privilege of collecting at 10¢. a can. Garbage taken
by him to his hog farm.</p>

<p class='c000'>The city of Brockton, Massachusetts, owns the land and
buildings necessary for feeding swine, also the horses and
teams necessary for collection. The Mayor’s office reports
that the city has not been able to make any profit on this
method of disposal. In fact, for the last ten years the average
cost to the city has been about $5,000 annually.</p>

<p class='c000'>Taunton, Massachusetts, collects garbage only in the
center of the city. The remainder is taken by private parties.
The city has only two teams and two men at work.
The Secretary of the Board of Overseers says that “in consequence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>of doing things in this way it is of little or no expense
and gives quite good satisfaction.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The expense and receipts during one year for the piggery
were as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>New Haven, Connecticut, pays $18,000 a year for the
collection of its garbage, which is hauled to a farm rented
by the city and fed to hogs owned by the city. The Board
of Health reports: “Outside of some complaints from the
piggeries we have got along. Our Board has repeatedly
recommended the destruction of the same, but as yet nothing
has materialized.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A special commission made an investigation and report
on the collection and disposal of municipal waste in Worcester,
Massachusetts. After investigating all methods of
disposal it reached these conclusions: “That the disposal
by feeding is the most economical method; that the greatest
intrinsic value of the garbage, the feeding value, is made
use of; that the garbage of Worcester can not only be disposed
of without cost but that the revenue from the sale of
hogs has almost been sufficient to pay for the collection.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Commission recommended that the present method
of feeding to swine be continued.</p>

<p class='c000'>In its report it gives the per capita cost of collection and
disposal as $.072 for Worcester and $.095 for Brockton.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Worcester municipal piggery is the largest and
most successful. The garbage collected by the city is fed
to a herd of hogs numbering about 1700 in winter and 4000
in summer. During the winter practically all hogs are
housed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The necessity for sterilizing garbage before it is fed
to hogs is disputed. Salem, Cambridge, Grand Rapids,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>Taunton and Brockton report that garbage is not sterilized.
New Haven reports that some is sterilized. Colorado
Springs and Omaha require all garbage to be sterilized.</p>

<p class='c000'>In his report of the sanitary survey of St. Joseph, Missouri,
J. H. White, Surgeon, United States Public Health
Service, makes the following statement with regard to the
disposal of garbage in that city:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Kansas City, Providence, Denver, Omaha, Colorado
Springs and other cities have their garbage fed to hogs,
with the uniform result that the cost of removal is reduced
to some extent to the city and that the contractor, according
to his business capacity, is able to make more or less profit
from the feed so obtained. There is no danger in this system
under proper handling. Any supposed danger to the
hogs can be prevented by prompt handling of the garbage
to prevent unnecessary fermentation and by the use of the
hog cholera serum to prevent disease. The proper cleaning
of the pens, if in the city, eliminates any danger to man.
The Board recommends this system and I heartily concur
with them that it offers the best available solution of the
garbage problem.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Worcester Commission reports the figures for hogs
sold to a packing company during the last year from the
Home Farm. Of the 2,276 hogs sold, the Commission says
only 11 were condemned by the United States Government
Meat Inspectors, an average of only 0.48 per cent. of one per
cent., which average is much lower than it is on hogs shipped
in from the West to the same packing house. It further
says: “The feeding method, however, has been practised
with success in many cities, especially those in New England,
for many years. The great difference of opinion is explained
by the efficiency with which the sanitary conditions
at the farm are maintained.” It emphasizes the fact that
farms must be kept clean and in a sanitary manner, and
that this method of garbage disposal requires careful and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>intelligent supervision, as is the case with any other method
of disposal. No method of disposal will run itself.</p>

<p class='c000'>Following are comments received regarding this particular
plan of disposal:</p>

<p class='c000'>Health Officer C. C. Slemons, of Grand Rapids, Michigan,
says: “From observation I am of the opinion that one
of these farms (municipal piggery), properly conducted, is
a paying proposition, but I do not think to the extent of
paying for collection. From my observation I would be
rather skeptical of a city going into this business. It is a
business that needs very close supervision and unless a person
is financially interested in it I doubt very much if the
experiment would pay.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mayor Fred. W. Keller, South Bend, Indiana: “Some
of this work was done several years ago. However, there
was some objection on the part of taxpayers to it being
hauled out of the city with municipal teams. It should be
fairly profitable, but the farm and hogs should be owned by
the city or the garbage disposed of to the concern that does
own the hogs and farm and this done by receiving competitive
bids. I make this latter suggestion in order to avoid
criticism by taxpayers.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Lawrence, Massachusetts, reports: “Those who have
looked into this question contend that the city swill can be
utilized to support a municipal piggery at considerable
profit.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In a recent report, the Iowa State College says of this
method of disposal: “The only advantage which may be
stated in favor of this method is that it probably costs less,
under existing conditions about most of our cities, than any
other available method.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In one of its annual reports, the Massachusetts State
Board of Health says: “It is objectionable and unsanitary
in the extreme, as health authorities are constantly pointing
out. Prominent among the objections to this method are
the great nuisance it usually creates and the uncertainty of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>its operation.” The Board says epidemics among pigs create
the uncertainty of operation. It also says that they are
breeding places for flies and rats.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Chicago Waste Commission’s comment on this
method is that it is not applicable or desirable in a large
city, except under inspection and for restricted private collection.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <cite>New York Medical Journal</cite> reported that the garbage
collected by Grand Rapids, at cost of $26,320, is taken
by a contractor who last year paid 45 cents per ton and fed
to hogs. It says that over 10,000 hogs are sold yearly at a
value of $135,000 and that 2,400 tons of fertilizer are produced
at a value of about $36,000.</p>

<p class='c000'>Samuel A. Greeley, Sanitary Expert, says that 75 pigs
are required to dispose of a ton of garbage per day. The
equipment at the farm prescribed by him is: Tracks and
cars for distributing the garbage along concrete feeding
platforms; substantial and well-kept sleeping and warming
pens; tanks for sterilizing garbage; apparatus for vaccinating
pigs against cholera; a means of disposing of unconsumed
garbage by burial or incineration and plenty of washing
facilities. He further says: “There should be some
method of sorting the garbage before feeding it to pigs so
that the stale garbage may be discarded and buried or
burned. Some places disinfect it by boiling in large caldrons
before feeding. In such cases the cooked garbage is
commonly used only as a base for the feed given to pigs.
The method is a most profitable one and warrants consideration
in small cities where isolated farm sites are available.”</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Dumping on Land</h3>

<p class='c017'>It is the consensus of opinion in all reports and of all
experts that this method is objectionable especially where
there is a large quantity to be disposed of. A long haul is
necessitated by the location of the dumps at a remote distance
where the decomposition of any part of the refuse will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>not be offensive to neighboring property owners. When the
garbage is deposited in sufficient quantity offensive odors
due to fermentation and decomposition may create a nuisance.
Unless special attention is given to the treatment of
these dumps, this method will not be found desirable. A
thorough mixing of garbage with ashes and rubbish will
prevent the nuisance and the fires that are otherwise liable
to occur, creating odors and nuisance from the smoke and
unconsumed gases.</p>

<p class='c000'>A report of the Iowa State College states that dumps
where ashes and rubbish and other refuse are deposited are
not only unattractive in appearance, but are detrimental to
the health of those living in the immediate vicinity, and as
a city grows, it usually becomes increasingly difficult to
find locations where these dumps can be maintained without
incurring the objections of those living in the neighborhood.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <cite>Scientific American</cite> says this method “is one that
cannot be defended either from an æsthetic or sanitary
standpoint. The dumps become an ideal breeding place for
flies.”</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Dumping in Large Bodies of Water</h3>

<p class='c017'>Only a few cities use this method. In most places where it
has been tried, it has been prohibited because the material
is washed on the neighboring shores.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Disposal by Sanitary Fill</h3>

<p class='c017'>This method is practised by some cities, among them Seattle,
Davenport, and New Orleans, which report its success.
It is given more serious consideration than heretofore
by several large cities. The method is different than that
of burial, in that it is carried on by filling excavations, vacant
low lying ground and natural ravines.</p>

<p class='c000'>The garbage, rubbish and ashes are dumped and then
mixed with sufficient earth to insure oxidation and thorough
digestion of the decomposable wastes. The activity of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>bacteria of the soil breaks down and mineralizes the organic
matter and when there is sufficient oxygen, i. e. air,
no putrefaction or other odors result. Success depends
upon the following treatment:</p>

<p class='c000'>(1) The garbage must not be buried so deep that bacterial
activity is reduced.</p>

<p class='c000'>(2) The garbage must not be spread in a thick layer on
the surface of the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>(3) The ground must be sufficiently open and drained
so that air can penetrate to a sufficient depth.</p>

<p class='c000'>(4) The garbage must not overload the soil, but must
be sufficiently diluted with earth, ashes and rubbish, so that
putrefaction may take place, due to the presence of an
ample supply of air in the pores of the soil.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Chicago Waste Commission believes that this
method “has been demonstrated to be not only sanitary,
free from nuisance when properly carried out, but economical
as well.” Incidentally, adds the Worcester Commission,
it adds valuable taxable property from which the city subsequently
derives an income.</p>

<p class='c000'>At Davenport, 1.3 cubic yards of materials are required
per ton of garbage and the total cost of upkeep,
including rent of land, labor, etc., was 50 cents per ton. The
garbage is received and buried by one foreman and three
men in summer and one foreman and one man in winter.
The city by this method is creating a valuable river front.</p>

<p class='c000'>New Orleans seeds its dumping grounds as soon as a
sufficient filled area is available, and later trims and plants
the land for use as small parks and play grounds.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Health Commissioner of Seattle, in a letter to the
<cite>Municipal Engineering Journal</cite>, describes the system and
results as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>“This method of filling works very satisfactorily in this
climate, but I believe it necessary to include all waste materials,
as ashes, boxes, tin cans, etc. These all assist oxygenation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>and nitrification. I do not believe pure garbage can be
handled in this way.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We also find that it is best to keep as little of the face
of the fill exposed as possible. It is always best to keep a
man constantly on the job, whose duty it is to rake down to
the bottom of the fill all boxes, rough materials, etc., thus
leaving the ashes to form a covering on top. When this is
not sufficient, we cover with a layer of earth about five inches
thick.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The success lies in the proper mixtures of waste materials,
and next the fill must be properly covered to protect
from flies. Chemicals can also be used to protect it. This
covering also prevents the slight sour odor of fresh garbage
and by keeping out the sunlight, at the same time encourages
bacterial growth by increasing the warmth inside the fill.
People residing within one hundred feet of these fills make
no complaint, but the public has to be educated when you
first adopt this method. We aim to fill city property, as
ravines, swampy lands or docks on the lake or salt water
front.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Our laboratory findings show that the process is simply
one of slow incineration by nature, instead of the expensive
method of burning by incinerators, and at the same time
help prove that there is nothing detrimental to public health
in these fills.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We have eleven fills distributed over our city, thus
making short hauls, and these are taken care of by eleven
laborers disposing of approximately three hundred and fifty
tons per day by this method alone, while one incinerator with
about an equal payroll will only dispose of sixty to seventy-five
tons per day, running twenty-four hours. A fill increases
the value of property, while the refuse from our
incinerator has to be hauled away at an added cost.”</p>

<p class='c000'>After spreading, there is applied to the garbage an antiseptic
spray of crude carbolic acid, rosin and caustic soda
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>to kill eggs and larvæ of flies, mosquitoes and other insects
that might breed.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Burial</h3>

<p class='c017'>Garbage may be buried by putting it in shallow trenches
and covering with the excavation from the trenches for the
next day’s deposit, or by plowing under. It digests and
is thoroughly taken up by or oxidized by the action of the
soil. Experience has shown that for open soil 1.5 acres are
required to handle each daily ton of garbage for one year,
the same soil being in shape to re-use after two years. For
heavy soils and those containing clay, about three acres are
required and this can be used again after three years.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Worcester Commission reports that cities which
have buried by plowing have experienced more than occasional
nuisance. Milwaukee and Columbus successfully
disposed of their garbage by burying in trenches, before
they constructed disposal plants. Milwaukee paid forty
cents a ton to dispose of its garbage by this method.</p>

<p class='c000'>A summary of the opinions indicates that disposal by
burying when properly conducted and when the point of
disposal is suitably located gives no cause for objection from
a sanitary standpoint. The principal objections are the
extremely long haul, the amount of land necessary and no
direct income. In small communities this method is entirely
satisfactory. It is usually not applicable to large
communities.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Disposal Plants</h3>

<p class='c017'>There are two methods of disposing of garbage in plants—incineration
and reduction. There is a wide diversity of
opinion among experts and city officials as to which is the
better from a sanitary and financial standpoint. There is,
however, nearly universal opinion upon the following:</p>

<p class='c000'>1. That the revenue from the by-products of municipally
owned and operated plants will not pay the combined cost
of collection and disposal.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>2. That with only a few exceptions the revenue from the
by-products of municipally owned plants does not pay the
cost of disposal.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. That the price received by cities from contractors is,
with very few exceptions, not sufficient to pay the cost of
collection.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. That the disposal of garbage by the reduction process
is uneconomical for a city with a population of less than 100,000.
Some experts increase the size to 150,000 and one to
200,000.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. That incineration is better than reduction for a city
with a population less than 100,000.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reduction in the per capita production of garbage,
due to less wastage of food in the American home since the
war, may make it necessary in the future to increase the
size of the city which can profitably employ the reduction
method, or should use the reduction method.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the report of the Chicago Waste Commission, some
general rules are laid down for the design of a disposal
works, irrespective of method. It says that the design
should permit the plant to be operated as a whole, or in part,
so that each part can be operated as an independent unit.
This will permit one or more parts to receive attention and
be repaired during the season when the minimum quantity
of refuse is to be disposed of. The details of the plant should
be such as to permit cleanliness at all times and hosing and
washing so as not to permit garbage dust or dirt to accumulate,
flies to breed and material to decompose. All material,
so far as possible, should be enclosed during the process
of disposal, and the odors eliminated or confined or deodorized.
The handling of material in the plants, so far as
possible, should be eliminated, where mechanical means can
economically be adopted. Special attention should be paid
to ventilation and the elimination of dust where men are
required to work.</p>

<p class='c000'>The odors or nuisances caused from disposal plants will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>usually arise from one or more of the following sources:
Garbage or refuse, incomplete combustion or combustion
temperatures not sufficient to eliminate odors, congestion of
carts in one locality and creation of dust. The odors arising
from raw garbage which are found in all plants are
mostly local and will not create a nuisance a short distance
from the point of handling and the housing of equipment
used in hauling.</p>

<p class='c000'>A method of determining the kind of a plant to be built
and operated which will meet with local conditions is described
as follows by Rudolph Herring, sanitary engineer.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Locate suitable central points where incinerators can
be built convenient for reception of refuse and delivery of
steam and clinker. Estimate annual cost, including fixed
charges and operation, as follows: First, of wagons and
other means of collecting from house to works all garbage,
ashes and rubbish combined; and, second, of the works for
incineration. The sum of these two estimated costs will give
probable annual cost of entire plant from origin to finish.
This sum must then be credited with the annual value of
steam and clinker. The result will be the net annual cost
to the city of collecting and finally disposing of the above
parts of general refuse.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A. Locate suitable place where reduction process can
be carried on economically and conveniently for reception
of garbage and delivery of products, with a capacity to
serve, if practicable, the entire city. Estimate annual cost,
including fixed charges and operation, as follows: First, of
wagons and other means of collecting the garbage from
house to works; second, works for reduction. The sum of
these two estimated costs will be the probable annual cost to
the city of the collection and reduction of the garbage. This
sum must be credited with annual value of products of reduction,
as derived from sale of oils, grease and fertilizers.
The result will be the net cost, perhaps profit, of disposing
of city garbage.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>“B. Locate suitable central point where incinerator can
be built, which will be convenient for the reception of ashes
and rubbish and the delivery of steam and clinker. Estimate
annual cost, including fixed charges of operation as
above of the collection and works for disposal of ashes and
rubbish, if these are to be incinerated together.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If only rubbish is to be collected and delivered for incineration,
then there should be added the cost of collection
and final disposal of ashes by dumping. This cost should
again be credited with annual value of steam and clinker
and perhaps of land-making by dumping of ashes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“By adding results of A and B, we obtain the total net
cost to a city of collecting and finally disposing of the above
parts of general refuse. A comparison between these estimates
of cost, of both collection and incineration of garbage,
ashes and rubbish as one project and of both collection and
reduction of garbage and the collection and incineration of
rubbish and dumping of ashes as the other project, will indicate
the most economical method in the city for which
these cost estimates have been made. It is necessary to
analyze carefully local conditions to determine the most economical
method.”</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Incineration</h3>

<p class='c017'>Two kinds of plants are used for this method of disposal—crematories
and destructors. Many destructors are in
operation in America, but of the crematories which have
been built, many have been abandoned. Heat for destruction
must be obtained not only from the garbage itself, but
also from ashes and other combustible waste. It is here
that the difference between destructors and crematories enters.
In the former, heat is obtained from the refuse itself;
in the latter, garbage is burned at the expense of coal, wood
or oil. It seems to be the prevailing opinion that in order
to make incineration a success the material must be burned
at a high temperature and rapid rate of combustion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Morse claims that destructors require twenty per cent.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>less area of ground, cost fifteen per cent. more for boiler and
machinery; that the construction is more durable; no addition
of fuel; that the gases of combustion are consumed, and
that this method has by-products of clinker and power and
destroys all combustible refuse; and that the net cost of
operation is less per ton.</p>

<p class='c000'>Crematories, Morse says, require more ground and more
time for disposal, but cost less. They are less durable, require
addition of fuel, gases are incompletely destroyed,
cannot develop power, the residue has no value and they
can burn only garbage and rubbish. The gross cost of
operation is a trifle less, but the net cost is more.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tests of garbage crematories in Ohio, according to the
State Board of Health, show that “the plants as operated
fail usually to dispose of the garbage at a temperature high
enough to avoid the production of odors.” This, says J. T.
Fetherston, Commissioner of Street Cleaning of New York
City, is significant and conclusive.</p>

<p class='c000'>Regarding mixed refuse destruction, Fetherston says:
“Three features may be noted: No added fuel is required,
steam power is produced and quite a residue (clinker) results.
Compared with tests of garbage crematories the
average destructor temperatures in connection with the gas
analyses indicate freedom from odor due to unconsumed
gas. Thus the mixed refuse type of plant corrects the inherent
defects of the garbage crematory.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The cost of incineration plants depends upon the garbage
to be handled. The various incinerator companies
usually estimate the capacity of the plant at about one ton
per 1,000 population.</p>

<p class='c000'>Reports show that disposal by incineration in Ohio is
confined to cities of from 20,000 to 80,000 population, and
that its success has been confined to the very large and to
the rather small cities of the country. Some assert that it
is applicable in the very large cities only when the collection
systems are suitable to provide for the burning of mixed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>refuse. In small cities it is the custom to cremate the garbage
alone, the other classes of waste being dumped or
buried.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cost of construction, reports show, ranges from $600
to $1,000 per ton capacity. The Worcester Special Waste
Commission says that “from a calculation based on some 30
incinerators it has been found that the cost per ton daily
capacity varies from $250 to $1,000, the average being between
$600 and $700.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The by-products are clinker and the steam generated.</p>

<p class='c000'>Robert W. Wylde claims that the cost of operating destructors
“is in a great measure offset and frequently quite
overbalanced by the revenue” from the sale of steam and
clinker. One hundred tons of refuse burned during 16
hours a day produces 800 engine H. P. Clinker from 100
tons might amount to 30 tons per day and would bring $1.00
a ton in many localities. Another expert says that one
pound of refuse has been found to produce one-half to one
and three-fourths pounds of steam. The value of refuse
as a fuel is estimated by one expert to be 49 cents per ton.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Chicago Waste Commission’s report points out,
“that experience in connection with the development of
power from refuse furnaces demonstrates that it is not easy
to find an available use whereby the power can be utilized
regularly as produced and the furnace operated continuously.
In the majority of plants constructed, it has not
been possible to utilize all the power available, and in most
cases the use is limited to the operation of the plant. When
power developed is used in lighting and power stations, the
demand only comes during a part of the day. Supplementary
coal-fired boilers are usually found in connection with
destructor-electric lighting stations, or else the destructor
is much larger than would be required to deal with the
refuse alone. The power produced from refuse furnaces
will be best utilized by some local industry, such as ice-making
plants or electro-chemical plants, which require
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>continuous operation. When power is used in connection
with pumping plants, it is found good practise to operate
the refuse plant only as an auxiliary to the power plant of
the pumping station. The saving that results or credit that
can be given the destructor plant will amount to the value
of the fuel equal to that which it requires to produce the
amount of steam developed and used. The fluctuating
amount of power developed in most cases can be depended
upon only for the average minimum production. In selecting
a site for a refuse disposal plant from which power is
developed it is not always profitable to utilize the power
where the demand is not constant and where the demand
would be constant, suitable sites are not always available.”</p>

<p class='c000'>William M. Venable, sanitary engineer, believes that if
a city has a steam power plant, it will pay, but it will not
pay to build one for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a suburb of Montreal, the refuse destructor is constructed
in connection with a municipal electric light power
station and power is used in generating electricity for lighting
purposes. The plant is operated only during the time
when lighting load is in demand, and the material as delivered
is stored during the day and burned at night. Only a
part of the power is furnished by the refuse furnaces, the
remainder being obtained from a coal-fired boiler plant.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Savannah, Georgia, the water works boilers are kept
in service, with banked fires, to use in case of shortage of
garbage.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following are some of the reports from cities which
receive a revenue from by-products:</p>

<p class='c000'>Minneapolis: The steam generated lights and heats hospital
and workhouse buildings, also lights 31 miles of streets.
Estimated annual revenue, heat $6,293.89; light $1,080.62;
street lights ($60 per arc) $4,657.48; total, $12,031.99.</p>

<p class='c000'>Borough of Richmond, New York City: West New
Brighton incinerator uses clinker in manufacture of brick
by mixing cement with ground clinker.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>New Orleans, La.: Plans perfected to light streets and
public buildings. Claimed that from 500 tons of garbage
daily 30,000,000 K. W. can be generated a year.</p>

<p class='c000'>Savannah, Georgia: Ninety-five per cent. of coal fuel
previously used at pumping station is now saved by destructor.
To operate water works pumping station it cost $81.90
per day. To operate the station and destructor it costs
$46.50 per day, or a difference of $12,921 per year, this being
10 per cent. of the cost of the plant. This is expected to
provide for repairs and amortization charges. Besides, the
city has all of its refuse disposed of without cost at a central
point and in a sanitary manner with freedom from nuisance.
The clinker is used for road building and is estimated
to have a value equal to the cost of hauling it from the plant.</p>

<p class='c000'>All reports agree that destructors are very successful
from a sanitary standpoint and have the advantage over
other methods in that the different classes of waste can be
destroyed by one process and gathered in one collection.
Several also agree that the destructors when properly constructed
and operated, may be centrally located, thus reducing
the cost of haul. Another point mentioned is that there
is some revenue. The disadvantages pointed out by experts
are that, if not properly designed and operated, there will
be dust and odors, all refuse must be hauled to the plant and
expert workmen must be employed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cost of operation varies from city to city, and in each
city from month to month, depending upon the season of
the year, composition of the garbage and climate. Most
incinerator companies guarantee to operate their furnaces
at full capacity at about 50 cents per ton. Milwaukee operates
for about 57 cents per ton. The cost, including maintenance,
depreciation and fixed charges, and operating expenses,
averages $1.50 to $2.50 and sometimes $3.00 per ton.
The State Board of Health of Ohio found in its investigation
that incineration cost from $1.97 to $2.50 in Canton,
Ohio; $2.00 to $2.66 in Marion; $1.00 to $1.84 in Steubenville;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>and $2.58 in Zanesville, during a period of several
years. These figures include interest, depreciation, maintenance
and repair charges.</p>

<p class='c000'>J. W. Turrentine, of the United States Department of
Agriculture, who made a study of garbage disposal plants,
says in a Department bulletin that the average net cost of
incineration per ton as obtained in a number of instances is
$2.11 per ton, and that in one of the cities considered there
is a credit for power generated of 22 cents per ton of garbage
incinerated.</p>

<p class='c000'>Most garbage incinerator manufacturers claim a life of
20 years for their plants with reasonable renewals.</p>

<p class='c000'>Morse figures that when fuel is necessary the cost of
destroying refuse and garbage in crematories is approximately
50 cents per ton. He also says that the cost of operating
destructors is from 50 cents to 70 cents per ton for
actual labor expenses, while the cost of operating the modern
high-temperature destructor will not exceed from 50
cents to 60 cents per ton. Deducting credit for power, the
cost will drop, he says, to 30 cents or less per ton. Depreciation
and capital expenses are not included in Morse’s calculations.</p>

<p class='c000'>Greeley asserts that the cost of operation will range from
about $1.00 to $1.50 per ton, “but local conditions may alter
these limits.”</p>

<p class='c000'>C. O. Bartlett, sanitary engineer, says: “So far as disposal
of garbage is concerned, in incinerators, it is coming
to be generally understood that this method is far from
sanitary and is essentially wrong in that it neglects to obtain
the value for the products so collected.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Rudolph Herring, Sanitary Expert, says: “In incineration,
if sufficient fuel is added, the combustion can be made
perfect and the garbage can be destroyed without offense
and converted into inodorous gases, ashes and clinker.
Whatever sanitary objection has been made to this process
has resulted from preventable causes. Unless ashes and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>rubbish are combined with garbage in sufficient quantities
to produce the necessary heat, the steam production is deficient
and other fuel must be added.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Robert H. Wylde favors incineration at a high temperature:
“Here we have a method that is at once sanitary, expeditious
and economical in first cost and maintenance.”
He also says that this method is free from nuisance, the
plant may be centrally located, cost of collection minimized
owing to the relative shortness of hauls, not necessary to
maintain a separate collection, nor is there any necessity to
keep refuse in separate cans.</p>

<p class='c000'>W. F. Goodrich, Sanitary Expert, maintains that modern
destructors are perfectly satisfactory and that there
may be no fear of nuisance wherever they are located. He
maintains that it should be the aim of officials to utilize the
power produced for the best interests of the community.</p>

<p class='c000'>William M. Venable believes that cities of from 10,000
to 40,000 population should burn garbage and refuse, the
problem to be solved being the advisability of attempting to
utilize the heat generated by burning.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Reduction</h3>

<p class='c017'>When the reduction method is used only garbage and
dead animals can be destroyed, but when these kinds of
wastes are broken down by means of heat, valuable by-products
are recovered. This may be done in two ways,
the processes being known as cooking, or digestor system,
and drying. In the first, garbage is cooked in large closed
retorts by means of steam under pressure. It is then
pressed, leaving grease and a dry cake known as tankage,
which is used for fertilizer. In the drying method the
grease is extracted by some volatile solvent like naphtha.
The relative advantages of these two methods is disputed.
At the present time the majority of plants are operated by
the cooking or digestor method.</p>

<p class='c000'>Within the last year or two a new reduction process has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>been evolved. The raw garbage is placed in sealed, air-tight
tanks with jacketed walls and bottom. The solvent is
pumped into the reducer and steam admitted to the jacketed
walls. The heat causes the evaporation of the solvent and
the water in the garbage. When the garbage has been
dried, the solvent is pumped into the reducer and dissolves
the grease. In an evaporator the solvent is vaporized and
carried to a condenser where it is again liquefied and then
conveyed to storage tanks. After the extraction of the
grease, the garbage is further dried by steam, and as tankage,
is used for fertilizer. The chief advantage claimed for
this system is that it is odorless. The cost of plant operation
is much greater than that of the digestor system, but
the value of the recovered products is considerably greater.
Plants of this type are being operated in Los Angeles, Cal.,
and in New Bedford, Mass. The plant now being constructed
for handling the garbage of New York City will
also employ this new process.</p>

<p class='c000'>C. O. Bartlett, Sanitary Expert, says that the cooking
method does not permit of the recovery of any considerable
portion of grease, but does provide for the retention of most
of the solids in dry form, after which they may be ground up
to serve as a base for fertilizers. He also says that it is
open to some objection on account of escaping gases from
the stack unless there are sufficient scrubbers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Irwin S. Osborn, sanitary engineer, sums up as follows
the advantages and disadvantages of each process:</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Drying Process</h3>

<p class='c017'><em>Advantages.</em>—Cost of plant is less, due to equipment
and space required; the operating costs are less, due to
amount of labor and power required.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Disadvantage.</em>—Carbonizing of the grease in the dryer,
due to high temperature required, so that the maximum
amount of grease is not recovered; the material is not broken
down so that solvent will act as readily on grease particles to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>allow maximum recovery; the mechanical condition of by-products
is not as desirable without additional treatment;
there is a greater volume of gases to be deodorized.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Cooking Process</h3>

<p class='c017'><em>Advantages.</em>—The cells of the material are more completely
broken down so that a larger amount of grease can
be more readily recovered; all material is enclosed during
the process so that the gases are more readily deodorized
with less volume to be deodorized; in the modern plants the
mechanical condition of the by-products is better.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Disadvantages.</em>—Increased fixed cost of building and
equipment; increased operating cost; increased maintenance
cost.</p>

<p class='c000'>Osborn believes that by-products produced by either
method have the same relative market value. In plants
that have been operated by both methods, the experience has
been that the additional amount of grease recovered by the
cooking method has more than offset the increased costs and
at the same time the odors were eliminated to a larger extent.</p>

<p class='c000'>In establishing a reduction plant, Rudolph Herring says
that the great fear is creating a nuisance. He further asserts
that, owing to unpleasant odors apt to arise at the
works, it is necessary to have good ventilation and also a
subsequent treatment of some of the vapors and liquids
which result from the process. These contingencies make
it advisable, he thinks, to locate the plant in a neighborhood
where the possibility of occasional unpleasant odors will
not materially injure value of adjoining property.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Chicago Waste Commission gives this suggestion
as a solution of the odor problem: “In addition to the steam
and electrical power that can be furnished from a destructor
plant to operate a reduction plant, the exhausting of all
gases carrying odors from the reduction works and passing
them through the destructor would prove one of the greatest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>advantages from a sanitary and economical standpoint
to be derived from a combined method of disposal of all
municipal wastes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Osborn says: “Economical results may be obtained by
utilization of heat in the disposal of garbage mixed with
other refuse, by burning, but to prove satisfactory the maximum
sanitary results must be obtained at a minimum cost,
and when the quantity is such that it will warrant utilization
the reduction method will continue to show more economical
results, and with proper attention given to details and sanitary
features the work can be conducted without nuisance.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Reduction is a method which can be adopted only by
large cities. It seems to be usually agreed that cities with
less than 100,000 population and producing less than 75 tons
of garbage daily will find the reduction process will not pay
as a business venture. One writer says in no place of less
than 150,000 population can these kind of plants be operated
successfully. Venable places the minimum population at
100,000. He says that as approximately 80 per cent. to
90 per cent. of kitchen garbage is water and only 10 per cent.
to 20 per cent. is composed of grease and other substances it
takes a large amount of garbage to make reduction plants
profitable.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cost of a reduction plant will range from $1,500 to
$3,000 per ton daily capacity, according to published reports.</p>

<p class='c000'>The gross cost of garbage destruction by the reduction
method varies from $1.50 to $2.50 per ton of raw garbage.
In only a few instances does the sale of the by-products meet
or exceed expenses. In a majority of cases, the process is
carried on by private companies, the most being subsidized
by cities to amounts varying from 50 cents to $2.50 per ton.
A few companies pay the city for all garbage delivered to
the plant.</p>

<p class='c000'>The by-products of the reduction method are grease
and tankage. It is generally agreed that ordinary garbage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>contains from 2 per cent. to 3 per cent. by weight of grease
and must yield from 200 to 400 pounds of tankage per ton.</p>

<p class='c000'>Columbus, Ohio, has been conducting experiments in
making alcohol from green garbage and its reports indicate
that cities having reduction plants may produce another
by-product from their waste. The experiments were carried
on for some time under the direction of the assistant
superintendent in cooperation with Dr. James J. Morgan,
a Chicago chemist who has patented a process of distilling
the alcohol from chemically-treated garbage. It requires
only a slight addition to the present processes of the plant.
The garbage is treated with a two per cent. solution of sulphuric
acid for cooking, then with lime and finally with
yeast for fermentation. The claim is made that the amount
of grease and tankage is not reduced by the process, and it
is estimated that every ton of garbage will yield about six
gallons of alcohol. The superintendent of the Division of
Garbage and Refuse Disposal in November, 1917, informed
the New York State Bureau of Municipal Information that
the final report on the experiment “was favorable to the
process, but our city council did not see fit to authorize the
installation of the necessary equipment for the process.”</p>

<p class='c000'>J. W. Turrentine says that on a basis of figures obtained
in the operation of a number of reduction plants, it is shown
that the average cost of reduction is $2.41 per ton, and the
gross receipts $3.30 per ton, giving a profit of 89 cents per
ton raw garbage. He asserts that when consideration of
cost of collection is excluded, the rendering of garbage is
distinctly more profitable than incineration.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cleveland and Columbus have been the cities most successful
in operating municipal reduction plants. In one
year the Columbus plant received 21,628.97 tons of garbage,
or 211 pounds of garbage per capita. From this and the
183 large dead animals received, the actual production was
as follows: Grease, 1,186,985 pounds; tankage, 1,753 tons;
hides, 183. The value of these by-products were: Grease,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>$57,672.21; tankage, $12,987.84; hides, $1,062.30, or a total
of $66,772.35.</p>

<p class='c000'>Each ton of garbage produced 54.87 pounds of grease
and 162.1 pounds of tankage. The grease value per ton of
garbage was $2,435; the tankage, 60 cents, and the hides
5 cents, or a total of $3,085 per ton of garbage. The actual
cost of operation was $40,220.78 or $1,859 per ton. The net
profits were $26,502.57 or $1.226 per ton of garbage.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cleveland in one year produced 2,940,000 pounds of
grease and 10,016,000 pounds of tankage, the city receiving
for them $151,162.48. This reduction cost per ton of green
garbage was $1.97½ and the earnings per ton of green garbage
was $3.47, making the net earnings per ton of garbage
$1.49½.</p>

<p class='c000'>New York City is selling its garbage to a private company.
It made a contract for 1914 to 1916, inclusive, and
the right to renew the contract for two more years on the
same terms and conditions. The city receives at the rate of
$62,500 for the first, $87,500 for the second, and $112,500
for the third and each of the succeeding two years. Plans
are now being made to operate a municipal plant.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CARE AND DISPOSAL OF MANURE<br /> <span class='large'>REGULATIONS IN MANY AMERICAN CITIES—PROVISIONS FOR STORING AND REMOVING THE WASTE—CARE OF STABLES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Some cities have made very stringent regulations for the
care, collection and disposal of stable manure within their
limits; others are not so exacting and many have not as yet
given any thought to the subject, or if they have no municipal
laws have been enacted. The importance of municipal
regulation is recognized by all sanitarians, and especially
since the house fly has been regarded as one of the chief
spreaders of disease. If for no other reason than to eliminate
the greatest breeding place of the fly, stable manure
should be properly cared for, and stables and other places
where animals are kept in cities should be clean.</p>

<p class='c000'>The regulations of most cities require the individual to
dispose of the manure on the premises he owns or occupies.
Only a few cities have a municipal collection system or have
the work done under contract. In those cities where gardeners
and farmers are permitted to collect the waste voluntarily
no trouble has been experienced during the winter
months when the farmer is not busy on the soil, but during
the spring and summer, when the need of cleanliness is
greatest, but when the farmer is too busy planting and harvesting,
the collection is neglected. Minneapolis is one of
the cities which have suffered in this way. In several cities
one or more companies deal in manure, maintaining wagons
exclusively for collection purposes. The manure is carted
either to the railroad direct for shipment or to persons purchasing
it. In most instances these companies pay a small
amount for the manure. The stable manure in Washington
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>is collected and disposed of in this manner. Toronto,
Canada, contracts with four different companies to remove
the manure. These make a nominal charge for the collection,
the city being under no expense. In Jersey City the
waste is carted away by private contractors and most of it
is sold to farmers. Denver transfers its stable manure to
the city dump where it is hid during the summer months
and in the spring is sold to gardeners. The city sanitary
inspector does not regard this plan as satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c000'>There seems to be an unanimity of opinion among most
municipal sanitarians that the city itself should be prepared
to remove manure when owners or occupants fail or refuse
to do so. Every owner should be allowed to sell it if he can;
otherwise, it should be regarded as a nuisance, and the city
should remove it without compensating the owner, but
charging him for the service. Unquestionably as cities continue
to grow and as congestion becomes greater such a plan
will be adopted by most municipalities.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the best systems in operation is that in Columbus,
Ohio, where manure is collected by municipal employees
from any stable within the city limits. The Columbus
ordinance provides that any person desiring to have the
manure removed must take out a permit for such service at
a yearly charge of $3 for one horse, $5 for two horses and $1
for each additional horse. After the ordinance became a
law the Department of Public Safety began to notify the
public that from and after April 1, 1912, no manure would
be removed without the payment of a fee.</p>

<p class='c000'>Between September 1 and June 1 the demand for manure
is greatly in excess of the supply and the city could sell three
or four times as much as it collects. During the remainder
of the year there is practically no demand for the waste as
farmers cannot handle it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The collection is made under the following rules: Whenever
a person pays to the city treasury the ordinance charge
for manure collection the Department of Public Service is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>notified on a blank form. The name, address, permit number,
and number of horses are recorded in alphabetical
order. To each of the four drivers employed in collection
is given a separate list of barns from which to collect, and
each evening he reports the places from which he made collection
during the day.</p>

<p class='c000'>Following is a detailed statement of the cost of collection
and the receipts from the sale of manure for 1916 when
prices were normal:</p>

<p class='c000'>The Civil Engineer of the Columbus Health Department
says that a market has been found for the entire output
of the city, the prevailing price being $2 a wagon load
delivered anywhere inside the city limits, and for shipment
$15 per average car f. o. b. cars, city loading station. He
further says that about 15 per cent. of the manure produced
in Columbus, a city of 200,000 inhabitants, is collected. “It
seems,” he says, “perfectly possible to collect all manure
produced in the city at a very low cost to the municipality,
for during the year 1913 only three 2-ton wagons were used
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>in manure collection and they proved to be sufficient to handle
the work with ease.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In Chicago manure must be removed every seventy-two
hours and collected by licensed scavengers at the expense of
the stable owner. Only during the last two or three years
was specific authority over stables granted to the Health
Department, which immediately began an inspection of all
stables. Of the first 500 inspected it was found that from
a sanitary standpoint they were in very poor condition.</p>

<p class='c000'>An example of stringent regulations in a large city is the
ordinance adopted by New York City. It follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>“No manure vault, pit or bin shall be allowed upon the
premises used for stabling purposes, except upon premises
used for barning in unimproved sections of the city. All
manure and stable refuse shall be kept within the stable and
removed daily, or if not removed daily shall be pressed into
bales or barrels adequately screened or otherwise protected
or covered so that flies cannot have access thereto, or otherwise
treated as approved by the Department of Health.
All such manure or stable refuse so baled, barreled or
treated, shall be removed from stables at least twice weekly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The loading of manure for removal shall be done within
the stable without causing a nuisance.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No person shall engage in the business of transporting
manure or drive any cart for that purpose, in the City of
New York, without a permit therefor issued by the Board
of Health or otherwise than in accordance with the terms
of said permit and with the regulations of said board.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The permit issued by the Board of Health shall be securely
fastened in a conspicuous place, on the right side
near the front of the vehicle used in the transportation of
offensive materials. Vehicles used in the transportation of
offensive materials while loaded, either wholly or in part,
shall not remain on the street or place any unreasonable
length of time, and shall not, except when unavoidable, stop
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>in front of any premises other than those from which material
is being collected.</p>

<p class='c000'>“All vehicles and contents therein shall be thoroughly
cleaned upon the completion of a day’s use, and so stored as
not to cause a nuisance.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Manure may be transported to a dump operated under
a permit issued by the Department of Health or to firms in
the unimproved sections of the city, or to points outside the
city of New York. Every vehicle used in transporting
manure shall be tight and provided with a suitable cover so
as to prevent the dropping of manure upon the streets; if
the cover be of canvas or of other similar material, it shall
be of sufficient size completely to cover the manure within
the vehicle and shall be securely fastened on all sides of the
vehicle.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No vehicle engaged in the transportation of manure
shall be permitted to load upon the sidewalk, in the alleyway,
in the yard or any place except the stable.”</p>

<p class='c000'>For a small city the ordinance of Newburgh, New York,
contains several good suggestions. It is as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>“All stables, barns and other places wherein horses or
cattle are kept, shall be kept in a clean and sanitary condition.
All accumulations of manure shall be stored in such
places and be removed with such frequency and in such
manner as to prevent offensive and noxious odors. Not
more than two loads of horse or cow manure shall be allowed
to accumulate on any premises within the city limits and no
piles of manure shall be allowed to accumulate in any
position or manner whereby they shall become breeding
places of flies or whereby any leachings therefrom may pass
into any stream or water course. Any violation of this
ordinance shall subject the offending party to a penalty of
not more than $50 for each offense and for each day’s continuance
or repetition of the offense.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No manure or stable refuse shall be deposited within any
building or the cellar thereof unless said receptacle shall be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>enclosed by eight-inch brick, cement or concrete walls, all of
which shall be waterproofed on sides and have cement waterproof
floors, and connected with public sewers by suitable
tile pipes properly trapped and with suitable fall to carry
off all liquid, said outlet to be covered with fine grating or
screen, top of said pit or receptacle to be covered with a
tight cover and to have a brick, cement, concrete or galvanized
iron flue, at least eight inches in diameter, and to be
air-tight and to extend to the top or cover of said receptacle
or pit up to and through the roof, and at least three feet
above said roof and above the roof of any adjoining buildings,
access to said pit to be by door hung on suitable hinges
and to be kept closed and fastened except when refuse is
being deposited in or removed from the same; in no case
shall said receptacle be constructed within any building
where no connection can be made with public sewers. All
receptacles for manure or stable refuse that are constructed
outside of any building shall be commenced at least twelve
inches below the lowest grade of the land adjoining same
and shall be waterproof on both sides and covered with
suitable cover properly hinged and to be kept closed except
when depositing therein or removing manure or refuse
therefrom; the sides of said pit may be constructed of
matched plank and as directed by the health officer; all of
the above construction must be so done as to make same
inaccessible to flies.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Exceptional regulations have been noted in the following
cities: Aberdeen, Washington, does not allow a bin or
receptacle to be built nearer to an adjoining house than 25
feet. Manure for agricultural or garden purposes must be
thoroughly mixed and covered with soil so as not to attract
flies. Bayonne, New Jersey, will not allow any pit nearer
than 10 feet to the line of any adjoining lot, alley or public
place. Truck gardeners must secure a permit to store
manure, and the waste cannot be carted through the streets
between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m. without a permit. Manure cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>be unloaded, discharged or put upon or along the line of
any railroad (except in transit), street or highway. A permit
must be secured for cars containing manure to remain
on or stand on or along any railroad, street or highway. In
Cincinnati disinfectants must be used about those portions
of the floor where manure and urine habitually fall or are
maintained. Manure stacked for fertilizer on a truck farm
must be at least 50 feet from any dwelling and shall be
stored in a closed bin or screened receptacle in order to
prevent access of flies thereto.</p>

<p class='c000'>Los Angeles requires a permit from its Health Commissioner
for piling manure for fertilization, the permit to
designate the place and amount that may be kept. Manure
cannot be scattered even if covered in Mankato, Minnesota,
except for fertilization or the “protection of plants, shrubs,
houses or buildings in winter months.”</p>

<p class='c000'>North Yakima, Washington, requires that manure used
as fertilizer from May 15 to October 15 must be mixed and
covered with soil. It cannot be used as grading.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Oyster Bay, New York, no manure is allowed to be
brought in or unloaded or placed on any dock or landing
from June 1 to September 1. All manure brought into town
must be entirely removed by June 15. All brought in by
rail must be unloaded within 250 feet of any station. Several
cities provide that all collections or accumulations of
any hennery park, stable refuse or manure in or about any
hennery park, barn, stable, yard or appurtenance thereof
must be removed before the same shall become offensive.
Dumping of manure in any river, canal, stream or pond is
prohibited in Little Falls, New York. Every person keeping
a stable for horses, mules, cows or similar animals in
Poughkeepsie, New York, must report his name and the
location of the stable to the Health Officer.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is no general uniformity of regulations as to how
often manure shall be removed. In some cities the ordinances
are specific, in others the refuse must be removed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>when ordered by the Board of Health, and in many it must
be carted away before it becomes offensive. Some of the
various regulations follow: Aberdeen, Washington, every
30 days from April 1 to November 1, and oftener if the
Health Officer directs; Bayonne, New Jersey, once a week
in all cases where the Board of Health by written notice
shall require; Chattanooga, Tennessee, once a week; Cincinnati,
Ohio, once a day and disposed of to the satisfaction
of the Health Department; Des Moines, Iowa, twice weekly
from March 15 to December 1 and once a week thereafter;
Erie, Pennsylvania, accumulation of only one wagon load
from May 1 to October 1 in any private stable, and two loads
in any private or livery stable without permission of Board
of Health; Greenfield, Mass., where more than four horses
are kept it must be removed at least once a month and no
more than five cords are allowed on premises at any one time;
Los Angeles, California, every ten days when kept in bins
and every day otherwise; Mankato, Minnesota, as often as
necessary and when ordered by the Board of Health.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every city and town should regulate at least the care of
manure and in congested communities it is imperative that
the city either provide a municipal collection or make provisions
whereby the refuse can be removed under contract.
Any community which fails to do this continues a nuisance
and fails to check the breeding of flies and the possible
spreading of disease.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>MUNICIPAL CLEAN-UP CAMPAIGNS<br /> <span class='large'>INTENSIVE COMMUNITY EFFORTS TO TEACH URBAN RESIDENTS THE NEED OF CLEANLINESS AND FIRE PREVENTION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Cooperative effort to give the municipality a thorough
cleaning at least once a year, and, by so doing, to teach the
citizen the importance of continuous cleanliness in and about
his home, has been undertaken within the last ten years by
most American cities. These intensive community efforts
are popularly known as clean-up campaigns.</p>

<p class='c000'>At first the clean-up campaign, lasting a day or two, was
devoted to ridding homes and yards of rubbish and waste
that had accumulated during the winter months. Later the
campaigns were spread over a week or a longer period, and
now not only is an effort made to collect and cart away the
winter’s accumulation of waste, but the city also undertakes
to educate its citizens in fire prevention work, fly and mosquito
extermination, the beautifying of homes and yards,
and the elimination of every unsanitary condition. Cellars,
garrets, back-yards, vacant lots, alleys, public streets—in
fact, every spot in the city, whether on public or private
property, does not escape the scrutiny of the public officials
and citizens’ committees.</p>

<p class='c000'>The movement spread rapidly until practically every
city had at least a spring campaign. Some repeated the
effort in the fall. After two or three annual campaigns
several municipalities, particularly the larger ones, thought
that instead of making a limited intensive effort to clean
house, a continuous campaign should be conducted. The
advocates of this plan claimed that any periodical effort had
a tendency to make the average citizen clean up only during
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>the campaign, and that during the rest of the year he lapsed
into his usual indifference. Within the last few years, therefore,
some cities have abandoned the clean-up campaigns
and have made greater efforts during the entire year to rid
the community of all unsanitary conditions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The clean-up campaign, however, has become a permanent
municipal activity in America. It has taught the citizen
not only his responsibility in and about his home, but
also the need for greater activity by governmental agencies
to eliminate general unsanitary conditions.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Initiating a Campaign</h3>

<p class='c017'>In order to initiate a clean-up campaign, an agitation
for it must first be started. The press, civic organizations
and industrial life insurance companies have been the principal
agitators.</p>

<p class='c000'>The industrial life insurance companies reach the individual
citizen and endeavor to get his cooperation in the
movement for more sanitary laws and conditions. Unlike
the press they reach the foreigner and the class of people
who do not read the newspapers, or at most only the Sunday
editions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some idea of the possibility for individual and community
good which these agencies hold in their power may
be gained when one considers that one company alone has
millions of policy holders in the United States and Canada.
The collectors making their weekly or monthly calls distribute
leaflets and circulars disseminating sound ideas in
regard to public and private health.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not possible to over-rate the press as a factor in the
clean-up movement. The work of the newspaper does not
stop with the spreading of information both before and during
the campaign—in some instances it takes part in the
activities. The columns of the newspapers are open to
everything of a news nature that will materially assist—news
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>stories, special articles, editorials, daily programs, cartoons
and advertisements.</p>

<p class='c000'>While the removal of rubbish is essentially a municipal
affair, in many instances it was not until civic organizations,
such as chambers of commerce, women’s clubs and school
clubs, started an agitation for community effort that cities
realized their responsibility and inaugurated campaigns.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>The Organization</h3>

<p class='c017'>In planning the organization of the campaign, the Mayor
usually appoints a Clean-up Week Committee, consisting of
one representative each from the Department of Public
Works or Street Cleaning, Health and Fire. This committee
outlines the plan and scope of the work. Usually the
physical work is performed by or under the supervision of
the Bureau of Street Cleaning, although in some cities the
health officials have had charge of the work. After a plan
has been adopted to interest every man, woman and child in
the community, a proclamation by the Mayor starts the ball
rolling and the campaign is on.</p>

<p class='c000'>As it is only through local organization that cooperative
specific community steps can be taken, an effort is first made
to secure district organization. The industrial insurance
companies with their already well organized plans on clean-up,
baby welfare, health, fly and mosquito campaigns, are
important agencies for such steps in most cities. The aid
of public school principals, the clergy and others is also
sought. Very effective organization is secured also through
the help of the various welfare and civic organizations.</p>

<p class='c000'>The official Clean-Up Week Committee usually appoints
a Citizens’ Committee, representing the leaders of the financial,
educational, business and religious life of the city. The
members of this committee offer their time and services free.
The Citizens’ Committee is subdivided, sometimes into as
many as twelve committees, consisting, as in Philadelphia,
of finance, press, poster and printed matter, trade associations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>community associations, charitable and benevolent associations,
schools and school children, churches, retail
stores, street cars, vacant lots and fire prevention.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following is the plan of organization that has been
used by many small cities:</p>

<p class='c033'>One man and one woman as directors of the general
movement.</p>

<p class='c033'>A committee on public buildings, factories and stores.</p>

<p class='c033'>A committee on residences and outbuildings.</p>

<p class='c033'>A committee on streets and alleys.</p>

<p class='c033'>A committee on parking and planting.</p>

<p class='c033'>A committee on painting and repair work.</p>

<p class='c033'>A committee to interest school children.</p>

<p class='c033'>A committee to supply the teams and remove the rubbish.</p>

<p class='c033'>Captains for working crews for each day of the campaign.</p>

<p class='c000'>The plan of Cincinnati is a representative one where the
campaign is initiated and carried on by a civic organization
with the assistance of public officials.</p>

<p class='c000'>The President of the Chamber of Commerce of that city
suggested it might be worth while to start a clean-up movement,
and, accordingly, a number of letters were sent to
prominent people informing them of the proposed movement,
and asking, if they thought the idea worthy of merit,
to meet at the Chamber of Commerce on a certain evening.
Thirty-five persons, representatives of organizations and the
city government, all enthusiastic over the idea, met as suggested.
A committee, consisting of the Superintendent of
Schools, Superintendent of Salvage Corps, Executive Secretary
of the Chamber, and the Chief of Police, was appointed
to plan the organization and name officers and members
of committees. This committee submitted a report
laying out a plan along the following lines:</p>

<p class='c010'>1. Organization by districts coextensive with public
school districts.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>2. These district organizations to be uniform in character
as far as possible.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. The work in each district to be done by the people in
that district.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. General committees, the members to form the General
Council in charge of the campaign.</p>

<p class='c010'>5. An Executive Committee to be composed of the chairmen
of the General Committees, and to be in immediate
charge of the campaign.</p>

<p class='c010'>6. The campaign to extend over a number of weeks and
to be followed by a general inspection of the buildings
of that city.</p>

<p class='c000'>The report of this Committee, including its selection of
the Superintendent of Schools as General Chairman and the
Manager of the Civic and Industrial Department of the
Chamber of Commerce as General Secretary, was submitted
to a large meeting attended by representatives of the civic
organizations, the State Fire Marshal, the schools, the Fire
Prevention Bureau, the Salvage Corps and others. Its plan
of organization was adopted and its selection of members of
the committees approved. The Mayor promised the cooperation
of all city departments.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Publicity Plans</h3>

<p class='c017'>The keystone in the arch of any successful campaign is
effective publicity. This is obtained through newspapers,
bulletins, circulars, buttons, rubber stamps, placards, posters,
motion pictures, banners, trolley cars, bill boards and
private advertising.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cincinnati reports that no other factor contributed more
to the success of its campaign than the newspapers. By
giving daily reports of the progress of the work during
clean-up week the press created a rivalry among the various
wards.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Philadelphia campaign the total space devoted to
newspaper publicity amounted to 14,225 lines, or 88 full
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>length columns of printed matter, of one column a day for
eleven days in each of the Philadelphia newspapers. For
the benefit of the foreign born the same information was
printed in every foreign newspaper published in that city.
Cartoonists depicted Clean-up Week as a family affair and
showed it to be a real pleasure as well as a necessity. The
editorial writers in a more serious vein urged the necessity
of cooperation and pointed the way to communal benefits to
follow.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bulletins, properly distributed, are effective in arousing
civic pride and procuring the cooperation of householders.
The first should be the official proclamation by the Mayor.
The Mayor of Kirkville, Illinois, gave this advice in his
proclamation:</p>

<p class='c010'>If your store is dingy—paint it.</p>

<p class='c010'>If your awning is ragged and old, get a new one.</p>

<p class='c010'>If your walk is an eyesore to those traveling over it, repair
it or have a new one.</p>

<p class='c010'>If there are unsightly traps in front of your property,
or broken limbs, burn them.</p>

<p class='c010'>If in your back yard there are old, tumble-down sheds,
tear them down. The ground is too valuable, and such
things detract from the beauty of the home—and the
town.</p>

<p class='c010'>Clean out all barnyards and stables at once. Don’t give
the flies a chance to breed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Clean out the alleys back of your homes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Take all rubbish and ashes from your back yard immediately.</p>

<p class='c010'>By all means do your part to make Kirkville a cleaner
and more beautiful city.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some cities have obtained good results with circular letters
signed by some public official. These are usually sent
to the various organizations, ministers and physicians, asking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>them to urge the cooperation of their members, congregations
or the households they visit.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few cities have adopted the plan of sending letters to
all advertisers and every concern known to manufacture,
advertise or sell any kind of an article used for cleaning
purposes, requesting them to increase the amount of local
publicity.</p>

<p class='c000'>New York City in one campaign used four million circulars
printed in five languages. One circular reads as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>“To every owner, occupant, representative of any building,
apartment, room, yard or vacant lot: You are hereby
notified to prepare and place within the stoop line for removal
all rubbish and waste material, from lots, lofts, fire
escapes, cellars, yards, alleys, air shafts, rooms and apartments.
Old bedding, rugs, paper, furniture, broken-up
boxes, and barrels; glassware should be placed in barrels,
boxes and bundles. It is against the law to throw materials
in the streets. Neglect to comply with this notice will result
in prosecution. The wagons will call at 8 A. M. Wednesday,
May 20.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Placards bearing the silhouette figure of William Penn
majestically swinging a broom over the city from his dizzy
perch on top of the City Hall appeared in every one of the
3200 trolley cars during a Philadelphia campaign. These
were placed in the front and rear entrances in such a way
that only the figure was visible from the outside. The appearance
of the black and white sketch minus title or descriptive
matter of any kind was perplexing to the passengers
on entering the car, and they immediately looked at the
reverse side for an explanation. They got it in the form of
an announcement for the annual Clean-up Week, with just
enough information and advice to be profitable, and most
effective. This same figure was also distributed among the
schools, libraries, railroad stations and other prominent
places.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>In various cities buttons are distributed bearing such inscriptions
as “Clean Up and Paint Up. I Will, Will You?”
and “Scoot Home and Scrub.” Slogans are usually selected
after competition for a prize by the school children.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the most effective posters used are window signs
to call rubbish carts, and cards to be placed in the windows
of homes. One house poster announced “We are Assisting
in the Clean-Up and Paint-Up Campaign. Are You?”
Posters have also been used in street cars, and on wagons
and motor trucks. Fire warning cards have been sent by
some cities to cigar stores, fireproof material manufacturers,
and gas companies.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rochester, New York, was one of the first cities to have
fire warnings printed on caps for milk bottles. Others have
used the backs of transfer tickets issued by street railway
companies. One of the most effective fire warnings read:
“See that your good cigar or cigarette does not cause a bad
fire.” Philadelphia distributed blotters among the school
children. In Toledo the school children, dressed as little
White Wings, carried banners bearing the inscription
“B-R-I-G-H-T-E-N U-P.” The bill posting companies, in
some instances, donate space for the use of large posters.
Street cars and station platforms are also utilized in an effort
to attract the attention of citizens to do their duty cleaning
their premises. The delivery forces of department
stores and milk companies are pressed into service, each
wagon being supplied with pamphlets and cards to be left
with each package or bottle of milk.</p>

<p class='c000'>Motion pictures and lantern slides showing the ravages
of the fly, and actual conditions existing from dirt are an
important factor in bringing the necessity for cleanliness
before citizens and school children. By way of stimulating
effort in the school children of Kewanee, Illinois, motion
pictures were shown depicting the success of children in
beautifying their school grounds and gardens in other cities.
The members of the New York Street Cleaning Department
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>gave illustrated lectures during the Clean-Up Campaigns.
On the screens of 205 motion picture theaters in Philadelphia
were shown nightly for four weeks attractively arranged
slides telling the audience what to do and how to do
it. The “Before” and “After” clean-up pictures proved
very popular and instructive. Because of the great popularity
of motion pictures this form of advertising is especially
effective. The general secretary of the campaign
in Cincinnati had prepared a set of lantern slides from
photographs one year and these were used to illustrate addresses
given the next year.</p>

<p class='c000'>In all large cities there is much private advertising during
these campaigns. In some, the regular advertising pages
of the newspapers for weeks have individual advertisements
of department stores, calling attention to the reduced prices
of articles used for cleaning purposes. The more enterprising
managers try to outrival each other in the amount of
space covered.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rochester, New York, one of the pioneer cities in the
organization of the clean-up movement, arranged its publicity
for one of its recent campaigns thus:</p>

<p class='c010'>The cooperation of the daily press.</p>

<p class='c010'>The exhibition of slides in motion picture theaters.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sending letters to all lodges and orders asking for cooperation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Asking the light companies to print fire warnings on the
backs of their bills, and the railway companies to do
the same on their transfers. The light companies also
displayed similar information on their electric signs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Use of the Boy Scouts to distribute dodgers to householders.</p>

<p class='c010'>The cooperation of the clergy in preaching proper sermon.</p>

<p class='c010'>Cooperation of the real estate exchange in cleaning up
and keeping clean all buildings, of which the exchange
has charge.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>Inducing manufacturers to print suitable copy on pay
envelopes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sending fire warnings in printed form to cigar stores.</p>

<p class='c010'>Arrange that all caps for milk bottles during clean-up
week be printed with a fire warning.</p>

<p class='c010'>Secure the cooperation of all concerns selling fireproof
materials such as cement, asbestos, fireproof paint
and roofing, by asking them to advertise heavily during
the week.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Commissioner of Public Works consented to allow
posters to be placed on the back of rubbish wagons,
and the Commissioner of Public Safety offered the
use of the big fire engines for the same purpose.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>The Cooperating Forces</h3>

<p class='c017'>The greater the number of cooperating forces and agencies
the more successful will be the campaign. All contribute
to make the city more livable.</p>

<p class='c000'>The greatest factor in the clean-up movement is the
children. Nothing that is done can be accomplished without
their help. Of the hundreds of cities interested in
clean-up campaigns very few can be found where the school
children have not been actively identified with the work.
No stone has been left unturned to encourage the teachers
to give the children the clean-up spirit. One of the best
means of reaching adults is through their children, and the
education of the children themselves along these lines will
contribute materially to their sense of proper community
conditions when they become men and women. It is acknowledged
that what is most needed in a boy nowadays is
the right spirit, to insure him a clean life in talk, habits and
associates; keeping the city’s streets clean is a certain responsibility
that makes him more careful in his own habits.</p>

<p class='c000'>Children are pressed into service in many ways,—through
clubs composed of boys and girls, Boy Scouts, Camp
Fire Girls, City Clubs, Junior League Clubs and Junior
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>Civic Clubs. Cleveland, Chicago, New York, Spokane,
Paterson, N. J.; Salt Lake City, Dallas, Texas; Toledo,
Ohio; Denver, Colo.; Cincinnati, Pensacola, Fla.; Bay City,
Oregon; Antlers, Okla.; Denison, Texas, are only a few of
the cities where children have been active.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are various ways of rewarding the children for
their work. Some cities believe that money prizes appeal
to children more than medals, badges, etc., and so have created
special funds for that purpose, usually collected by
some civic organization. Other cities give medals, buttons,
puzzles, school equipment—stereopticon with lantern slides,
maps, pictures, plans;—sporting equipment—baseball and
football masks, balls and bats, cameras, free tickets to moving
picture theaters.</p>

<p class='c000'>In some instances the school children have become enthusiastic
to the point of organizing magazines in the
schools, devoted entirely to the Clean-Up Campaign. The
children of the Clifton School in Cincinnati issued a magazine
called <cite>The School Circle</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In some cities packets of flower and garden seeds are
distributed among the children, and all vacant lots, back
yards and stretches of ground not utilized are cleared of rubbish
and dug up and seeded.</p>

<p class='c000'>Under the direction of a Captain, school boys of Spokane,
Washington, were organized into corps which cleaned
up the residence section, then hauled the refuse away to the
public dumps in wheelbarrows and express wagons.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another method used to good advantage by Salt Lake
City was to get the boys of each district bordering on dirty
vacant lots to clean them up and prepare them for baseball
grounds. After this had been done the Inspector of Public
Health gave the boys baseball bats, balls and equipment.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the suggestion of Mayor Cochran of Antlers, Oklahoma,
the Progressive Club and the Ladies’ Civic Club combined
in a program that was very successful. The boys of
the city gathered up all the rubbish and placed it on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>curbs, and the city wagons removed it. A committee appointed
by the club solicited funds to reward the boys.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a preliminary to the general clean-up movement in
Bay City, Oregon, the Commercial Clubs, in conjunction
with the Ladies’ Civic League, offered three prizes to the
boys collecting the greatest number of sacks of rubbish by
April 5.</p>

<p class='c000'>One city in Ohio gave each child collecting one hundred
tin cans a free ticket to a motion picture theater.</p>

<p class='c000'>Judge Albert Besson of Chelsea, Mass., found a novel
use for six boys, averaging fifteen years old, brought before
him for sentence for entering freight cars and stealing
candy. He sentenced them to keep a certain city street
clear of waste for six months. The street in question is a
long one, and friends of the boys living on it made things
interesting for the culprits keeping the cigarette stubs, tin
cans, papers and milk bottles picked up. The boys were
supervised by two policemen.</p>

<p class='c000'>The children of the sixth and seventh grades in one
school in Inchester, Pa., started a tin can crusade, which
aroused every citizen in the city. With two days of the
contest still to run, the children had gathered 37,000 tin cans.</p>

<p class='c000'>In accordance with the proclamation of the Governor,
the Mayor of Montpelier, Vermont, observed April 25 as
Arbor Day and Clean-Up Day. Outdoor exercises were
held, including an address by the Mayor. The children were
not required to attend school in the afternoon provided they
spent two hours cleaning up the streets and grounds about
their homes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Toledo school children were divided into squads and to
each was given a section of a ward. Each day a ward was
cleaned and the results were printed in the next day’s papers,
thus creating rivalry among the children.</p>

<p class='c000'>Everywhere the Boy Scout has found his level in the
Clean-Up Campaign. It is a Scout law that he must be
clean. Almost every troop of Scouts has done its full quota
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>in civic, local or county clean-ups. In patrol or by troop
they care for school grounds, public grounds, make systematic
campaigns against flies and mosquitoes, destroy their
breeding places; plant trees, bushes and shrubs; in general,
keep the streets free of litter and waste of all kinds. Divided
into squads, they do much for city betterment. Vacant lots,
waste property, fields and streets are rid of tin cans, milk
bottles, scrap iron, weeds, and in their places flowers, vegetables
and shrubbery planted; unsightly billboards removed.
Sometimes they are paid for their work by the Civic
Leagues, as in the case of Cornwall, N. Y., and St. Paul,
Minnesota.</p>

<p class='c000'>In many cities the Scouts have done splendid work in
inspection duty, reporting all unsanitary conditions. In
patrols, troops or companies they are assigned to investigate
and report to the superintendent of streets or the organization
having charge of the clean-up. The inspection
is done day by day as the clean-up progresses, and any oversight
or unsanitary condition reported at once.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another method of interesting children is the organization
of boys and girls into what is known as City Clubs,
whose duty it is to keep the streets clean. The clubs are
limited to 25 members each. The members wear buttons
and each one is provided with blanks on which to report.
In some instances these clubs work throughout the year but
usually their work is confined to the spring clean-up, in
which event they attend to the general clearing up of vacant
lots, back yards, school property, and cart it to the curbs
for the city dump wagons to haul away.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Boston, under the auspices of the Women’s Municipal
League, the Junior Municipal League, loaded with posters
reading “Do you have pride in your city? Then Clean It
Up,” and armed with brooms, shovels and rakes, proceeded
to clean up. “Little Italy” was no small job. How the
children first became interested in cleaning up this district
is told about a little Italian girl who persuaded her merchant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>father to put covers on his barrels because the papers blew
about and littered the back yard. This so improved the
appearance that the child decided to sweep the back porch
every morning before going to school. One morning a policeman
saw her doing this and remarked on the improvement
and gave her a button; immediately all the children in
the neighborhood became industrious.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gratifying results were obtained in Kewanee, Illinois,
through the cooperation of the Superintendent of Schools
and the Junior Civic Club, consisting of 650 members from
the seven schools of the city. To each pupil desiring to become
a member was presented a button in the school colors,
bearing the words “I Will Help Kewanee.” A photograph
was taken of the child’s home, showing as clearly as possible
what he desired to improve. A letter was sent to the parents
of the members of the Club, stating that the Kewanee Civic
Club offered prizes to children who would make the most
progress in cleaning up yards at home, plant flowers, make
gardens, and do any other work. For the best showing in
each school district $5 in gold was first prize, and $2.50 in
gold second prize. To all the children who made an honest
effort to clean up and beautify their yards were given diplomas
of award signed by the Superintendent of Schools and
the Committee. The taking of the pictures was a most expensive
plan, but the expenses were materially reduced because
the Camera Club of the High School contributed
largely of their time. A contest in growing vegetables and
making gardens was begun in the summer, and in the fall
prizes were offered for the best showing. In order to stimulate
interest in that direction, motion pictures showing what
children had done in other cities were used.</p>

<p class='c000'>A school in one city presented a one-act play typifying
the following characters: Fly, waste, paper, fire, soot, dirt,
microbe, sickness, death, sorrow, poverty, cleanliness, swatter,
refuse pail, fire prevention, paint, scrub brush, soap,
water and flowers. Lines were fitted to each character, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>in the end cleanliness and happiness overcame sickness and
dirt.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although not always taking an active part in the cleaning
up, women’s clubs have been a great factor for good in
instigating general clean-up. There is scarcely a city in the
country where the women in one way or another have not
done much propaganda work, and in many instances offered
active service and financial support.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cincinnati is unanimous in its opinion that it owes its
successful campaigns to the Cincinnati Woman’s Club,
which organization was responsible for the first effort toward
a general clean-up years ago.</p>

<p class='c000'>The prominent women residents of Cornwall, N. Y.,
members of the Improvement Society, having failed to get
the Moodine Creek and adjacent property cleaned up by the
Board of Health, after an appeal, formed what they called
the Tin Can Committee, and started a campaign of housecleaning
on their own account. Flanked by a squad of Boy
Scouts, they marched to the Moodine with rakes and hoes
and began to clean up the thickets of the creek on both sides.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Special Activities</h3>

<p class='c017'>Besides the general cleaning work for the removal of
rubbish and waste many cities add special activities to their
programs. These are found to be helpful in improving
both sanitary and esthetic conditions. In a few cities drastic
measures are resorted to in special cases. In Philadelphia,
for example, the names of 600 owners of unimproved
property which required cleaning were obtained and to each
was sent a written request to improve conditions. The results
were gratifying. In other places photographs of unsanitary
conditions have been taken and the pictures either
published or sent to the owners or occupants of the premises.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Chicago an agitation was started to clean the roofs
in the downtown district, as it was claimed that most of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>dirt filling the air and streets was blown from the roofs,
which had not been cleaned since they were built.</p>

<p class='c000'>School gardens and tree planting are popular in many
cities and are made a part of the Clean-Up Campaign program.</p>

<p class='c000'>Through tireless energy the Director of Social Centers
of the public schools in Cincinnati succeeded in having hundreds
of school gardens planted. Many of these were
planted in vacant lots which had formerly been the abiding
place of heaps of rubbish. One was upon what had been
for years an objectionable public dump adjacent to a school.
Several loads of dirt were applied in the fall and the cost
defrayed from the campaign fund. In September an exhibit
of school garden products was held and prizes offered.</p>

<p class='c000'>Intensive vacant lot and back yard gardening campaigns
were conducted in most American cities during the spring
and summer of 1917. Although these campaigns resulted
from the need to increase production, they assisted materially
in eliminating many unsanitary spots in every city.</p>

<p class='c000'>A Cincinnati firm in former years distributed trees in
great numbers among the school children of the city and
adjacent communities. Upon the suggestion of the Clean-Up
Committee it decided again to make such distribution as
a part of the Clean-Up Campaign, this time peach trees.
Cards were given to all the school children who would agree
to plant and care for the trees. Eighty-four thousand of
these trees were distributed. The trees planted will bear
fruit worth many thousands of dollars. The distribution
of them formed a distinctive and unique feature of the Cincinnati
campaign.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Fire Prevention and Inspection</h3>

<p class='c017'>The fact that in Philadelphia in one year the loss by fire
from combustible materials alone was $300,000 shows how
important is fire prevention in the clean-up work. Realizing
the conditions and the effective means which clean-up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>campaigns offer to improve them, many cities have laid
special emphasis upon safety as well as sightliness and
cleanliness. The effort of Cincinnati illustrates the results
that have been achieved in many other communities.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>INSPECTOR’S REPORT (1915).</div>
    <div><span class='sc'>“Clean-Up and Paint-Up” Campaign.</span></div>
    <div>Under Auspices of Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_249.png' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>“The success attained in the Cincinnati campaign in 1914
so impressed the State Fire Marshal that he assigned one
of his assistants to spend his entire time in the 1915 season
going about the State organizing in the different cities clean-up
campaigns based upon the Cincinnati plan, and in which
inspections by the State Fire Marshal’s department played
an important part. Since it is estimated that 80 per cent. to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>90 per cent. of all fires are caused by accumulation of waste,
rubbish or trash of some sort, a thorough renovation of all
premises in the city must decrease the risk of fire. Therefore
the more thorough the Clean-Up Campaign the more
work done toward fire prevention. The $600,000 reduction
in fire loss, from $1,341,348 in 1913 to $793,796 in 1914, may
be traced largely to the result of the Clean-Up movement.
This means a reduction of insurance rates in the business
district of from 5 per cent. to 8 per cent. and an annual
saving of perhaps $160,000 in fire insurance premiums.”</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Sanitary Inspection</h3>

<p class='c017'>As a preliminary to the Clean-Up Campaign in Kirkville,
Missouri, an inspection was made of all grocery stores,
drug stores, bakeries, and dairies by the State Pure Food
Inspectors. The work continued over many months, and
every Sunday one of the local newspapers devoted an entire
page to the report of the conditions, good and bad. Each
concern was scored on various points of sanitation on the
basis of 100 per cent. perfect, and the Sunday papers printed
scores of all concerns inspected the previous week. Thus
the interest of the public was aroused to watch the scores.
In the instances where the low scores were made the effects
of public disapproval were instantly felt.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Flies and Mosquitoes</h3>

<p class='c017'>Swatting the fly and destroying breeding places play an
important part in the Clean-Up Campaign of every community,
and in nearly every city fly extermination literature
is distributed during clean-up week. Bulletins, rubber
stamps, fly traps, motion pictures, lectures, lantern slides,
and everything available are used to depict the ravages of
the fly. Fly extermination leaflets are sent to business establishments,
to mothers’ clubs, and post cards to merchants
whose places of business might be noticed to be fly infected.
Boy Scouts distribute the literature and also report as to
stable conditions. Letters directed to business establishments,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>suggesting the use of fly swatters and traps as advertising
material, are a further movement against the house
fly. In Cincinnati a circular explaining the need of exterminating
the winter fly was distributed through school
children, and a marked reduction in the number of flies was
secured. A special general committee on fly extermination
was named and became one of the most active factors in the
campaign. Classes in manual training in the public schools
made fly traps, the Public Library had prepared a complete
set of lantern slides on fly extermination, and the committee
had prepared and printed and distributed 50,000 circulars
on the house fly and methods of extermination.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>Results of Campaigns</h3>

<p class='c017'>A tour through any city on the first day after Clean-Up
Week will convince the most incredulous that in promoting
this movement the municipality materially lessens the fire
risk and makes a marked improvement in sanitary conditions.
Everywhere are heaps of waste materials and discarded
articles, such as old bed springs, mattresses, sofas,
glass, crockery, stoves, carpets, baby coaches, piled along
the curb.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following are some of the results conceded worth
while in most of the cities engaged in the movement:</p>

<p class='c010'>A continuous campaign accomplishing permanent good.</p>

<p class='c010'>Stimulation of business. A canvass of the cities having
clean-up campaigns resulted in the showing that 71
per cent. of the merchants were positive that their
business had been increased.</p>

<p class='c010'>Improvement of housing conditions.</p>

<p class='c010'>Distinct educational value for the young.</p>

<p class='c010'>Prohibition of open garbage cans in some cities.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sanitation in the handling of food products.</p>

<p class='c010'>Better laws and methods for the disposal of garbage and
rubbish.</p>

<p class='c010'>Reduction in fire loss; thus reduction in insurance rates.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>Elimination of unsightly lots and spots.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hundreds of school gardens.</p>

<p class='c010'>Renovation in most of the homes in a way they had never
before been renovated.</p>

<p class='c010'>A great reduction in the number of flies and mosquitoes.</p>

<p class='c010'>A stimulation of civic pride and cleanliness and safety
of the home.</p>

<p class='c010'>A united effort by practically the entire population toward
an end for the public good.</p>

<p class='c010'>The education of school children toward a better idea of
living conditions.</p>

<p class='c010'>The razing of dangerous buildings.</p>

<p class='c010'>Elimination of public dumps, prospective early elimination
of many more.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hundreds of new street litter cans.</p>

<p class='c010'>Cleaner yards and vacant lots.</p>

<p class='c010'>Distribution of thousands of fruit and shade trees.</p>

<p class='c010'>Collection of combustible waste by Salvation Army, relieving
Street Cleaning Department, and reducing
dump evil.</p>

<p class='c010'>Development of community spirit through united action
in a movement for public welfare.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fact that most cities have repeated their campaigns
from year to year should convince those which have not yet
inaugurated the movement that the effort is well worth
while. There are, however, a few large cities, New York
being one, in which the congestion of work which a campaign
entails creates a temporary situation which is unsatisfactory
and expensive. These municipalities, and even
many of those which have annual campaigns, are advocating
more methodical care of light rubbish throughout the year,
thus avoiding such a large spring cleaning. As a remedy
several cities have lengthened the period of cleaning to several
weeks. Generally speaking, however, clean-up campaigns
justify the effort and extra expense by making safer,
cleaner, healthier and more beautiful cities.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
